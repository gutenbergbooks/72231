<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>South Jersey is a very sandy country. There are miles
and miles of sand there. Some of it is very pure white
sand used for making glass and for molding sand. Some
of this sand has sharp edges but most of it is rounded
as if the grains had rolled around until the edges were
worn away. Mr. Kummel has written a paper about
this sand in the Report of the New Jersey State Geological
Survey for 1906. His paper is entitled “The
Glass Sand Industry of New Jersey.” It is a very interesting
paper though you might not think so from the
title.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are also very large beds of green and red sand.
The green sand is especially interesting because it contains
such immense amounts of alumina, iron and potash.
If our chemists can only find cheap methods for extracting
these substances we shall have enough to last us
forever.</p>

<p class='c015'>The most curious thing about this green sand is that
it is still forming in the water along our coasts. Here
the limestone shells of dead foraminifera are slowly
filling up with the green substance as their bodies decay.
The shells are slowly dissolved by the sea water at the
same time, so that the green sand grains give a perfect
cast of the inside of the shells.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>I became interested in this sand while I was in college.
The professor sent me down to Mullica Hill to get a
load of it to experiment with. He wanted to find a way
to work it. At Mullica Hill I heard that a farmer by
the name of Peter Norman had a pit on his farm. One
of the loafers there offered to go along and show me
the way. I told him he might go if he would get the
farmer to let me have a load of sand for nothing and
help me load. This he promised to do. On the way he
informed me that Norman’s daughter, Euphemia, had
taken a notion to him and that probably they would jine
up. I said I was looking for a wife myself and if I
liked her looks I would take her along, but I must be
sure first that she was a good cook. He looked me over
as if I were some kind of an insect and asked me how
much I weighed. I told him all of fifty tons.</p>

<p class='c015'>When we got to the house Euphemia came to the door
herself. I must say she was a fine looking girl with
very mischievous eyes. She said her father was down
at the other end of the farm and my friend had better
go and get him. Then she giggled. When he had gone
she looked at me and giggled some more. Said I might
go ahead and take all the sand I wanted. I asked her
if she was sure her father would be willing and she said:
Sure! She said she would show me the pit and got on
the seat beside me. As we drove along she told me that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>one of her girl friends had told Sim she was gone on
him.</p>

<p class='c015'>I said, “yes, so he told me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Did he?” says she, “the poor simp!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you go about breaking hearts like that,” said I,
“you’ll get in jail next. I understand that the sheriff
has been instructed to jug all the flappers.” This made
her giggle some more.</p>

<p class='c015'>She stood by the side of the pit while I threw the sand
into the truck. After I had been digging a bit my shovel
struck something that felt like rubber. It was round
like a rubber ball as I uncovered it and larger than a
canteloupe. I tried to throw it out, but it seemed to be
fastened to something at one side. I went on digging
and was getting interested when I heard some one
shouting, and there was the farmer coming as fast as he
could, waving his arms and shouting with all the breath
he had left. When he reached the pit he was puffing and
blowing so he could hardly speak, but he made it plain
that he was cross because I had dug without permission,
said I had no business to do it, it was trespass, and he
had a great mind to have me arrested.</p>

<p class='c015'>I said that his daughter had allowed me to dig but
this did not seem to satisfy him. Euphemia told him I
wasn’t hurting anything and he needn’t make a goose
of himself, so he quieted down. Asked what the round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>ball was? I told him I didn’t know and he got a shovel
and dug too. After awhile the girl said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why it looks like a man!”</p>

<p class='c015'>It did, too. We went on digging and uncovered his
legs and then his feet. They <i>were</i> feet all right, but he
was the queerest looking thing you ever saw. After he
was uncovered we turned him over and I declare he
had a nose, mouth and ears; it was a man! But the
oddest looking man you ever saw. His body was nearly
transparent; like cloudy glass. You could see all his
bones through this. He looked like stiff jelly with pieces
of cotton in it. We looked at him and then at one another.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I vum,” said Papa.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Did you ever,” said Phemy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Geewhitakers,” said Sim.</p>

<p class='c015'>The farmer brought out a wide board and we rolled
him on it. Then I nailed narrow boards on the side, so
that he was in a kind of a trough. There he lay, glistening
in the sunlight. When I looked up I saw that
Euphemia was giggling again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why the laugh?” said I.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t you think he looks funny? I never expected
to see a man’s bones like that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It hadn’t struck me that way before but it was funny,
and I had to laugh too. Just then the man sneezed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Euphemia gathered up her skirts, for she had on a long
dress, not one of the bathing suits the flappers wear on
the streets nowadays, and made a bee line for the house.
I felt kind of scary myself. It isn’t every day, I can
tell you, that you dig up a jelly corpse and have him
sneeze just as life-like! Pop Norman by this time was
as white as a sheet. But what the corpse did next certainly
made me stare. He opened one eye, and after
looking around a bit, confused-like, he looked at me,
and <i>winked</i>. I certainly was flabbergasted. Then he
opened the other eye and sat up. Then the farmer
scooted. The corpse began to talk to himself in some
kind of outlandish jabber. I thought it sounded like
Spanish but it came out like lightning and I couldn’t get
it. I had studied Spanish at college but I was not very
well acquainted with it. After saying the same thing
over three or four times he turned to me and said it
again—slowly, and quite imperiously. He was asking
where his clothes were. I said I didn’t know but would
enquire. I went to the house and found Euphemia very
badly scared and the old man drinking blackberry brandy.
He called it a cordial. I insisted that he get some clothes
for the stranger and we picked out an old suit I thought
might fit. I took these out to the Spaniard but he was
much displeased with them and said he was not accustomed
to such garb. I told him it was that or nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>and the girl was coming so finally he put them on. He
seemed to be about as spry as ordinary people, and his
manner was very polite.</p>

<p class='c015'>Euphemia got over her fright after awhile and came
downstairs but she seemed quite shook up. After awhile
the Spaniard tried to talk to her but of course she
couldn’t understand until I translated for her. After
awhile she seemed to like to hear what he said. His
talk was quite high-flown, and after every few words he
would put his hand on his chest and make a low bow.
This seemed to suit Euphemia.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was getting on towards evening and I was obliged
to leave but I asked Euphemia to take care of him and
I promised to bring a Spanish book so she could make
out what he said, and I told him to stay here until I
got back. He promised to do so and I went away.</p>

<p class='c015'>When I told the professor about my glass man he
smiled and smiled. He said the Spaniard must be a
silica gel pseudomorph, and he was surprised and delighted
he or it could talk Spanish, and when he said
this he grinned like a Cheshire cat. I got a Spanish
dictionary and phrase book at the college bookstore and
went back next day. I found he was trying to explain
the difference between <i>ser</i> and <i>estar</i>. It struck me that
was a funny thing to do, but he seemed rather touchy,
so I gave her the books and went back to college. I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>very busy the rest of the term and couldn’t get away,
but as soon as possible I went back. They were out
riding the old man said, and he seemed rather put out.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they came back I tried to tell her about the
green sand, but she didn’t seem to be interested and he
yawned; so, after talking to the old man for awhile I
came away. She didn’t ask me to come again. He was
polite but quite formal.</p>

<p class='c015'>I saw no more of the Normans nor of my Spanish
friend for a month. I was in Trenton one afternoon and
was walking on the street when who should I run into
but the Normans. They were staying with an aunt of
hers and I went with them. We sat up pretty late that
night while Euphemia told me about the Spaniard. She
said she wondered I hadn’t heard about it; part of it, it
seemed, had got into the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c015'>She told me she soon got so she could talk Spanish
pretty well. It was not difficult except that miserable
<i>ser</i> and <i>estar</i>. They both meant the same thing and you
were pretty sure to use the wrong one. I told her it was
like the old lady who knew the difference between soldier
and shoulder but never could tell which was which. She
said the Spaniard talked all the time. He was so polite
that at first she liked him pretty well, but he never
seemed to like her father and didn’t treat him very well.
He claimed to be a hidalgo, which appeared to be some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>kind of a nobleman. He was terribly stuck on himself.
He was a ferocious eater and kept her cooking most of
the time. He was always asking for <i>dos huevos fritas</i>
or <i>carne de vaca</i>. “He kept me fryin eggs or Dad
runnin to town for meat all the time. I believe he
could eat a gallon of soup, and it took so much butter
to fry the <i>papa fritas</i> that we had none left for anything
else. He was fond of fish, too, and was always
askin for them. This got so bad that Dad and I concluded
we had better take him down to the shore where
fish don’t cost so much. By this time something got the
matter with him. It had been rather cool and moist up
to this time but by the time we were ready to start there
was a hot dry spell. Before this you could see everything
inside his head except where the bones were in the
way. But now white patches like snow began to grow
on his face, and pretty soon he began to look like a
snow man. His face was perfectly white without a
trace of color. It was frightful. I kinda liked his looks
before that. You needn’t laugh; you like the good
lookin women best, and I don’t see any reason why we
shouldn’t like the good lookin men.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If he didn’t get what he wanted at once he flew into
an awful rage, and it was pretty fierce, I can tell you,
to have Snow White rampagin around. So we took him
to the shore, or at least we started for the shore. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>had a sword that the blacksmith had made for him out
of an old scythe of Dad’s and belt around him to hold it.
I said we might be arrested for carrying such things
around, but Dad said you could not carry concealed
weapons, but nothing was said about other kinds, and
there was nothing concealed about that sword. So we
started off in the wagon, and he sat in the front seat
with Dad. Pretty soon I noticed that little white scales
was driftin down from him on the floor. It was hot
that day but he didn’t seem to feel it in any other way,
but all the time those little white scales kept siftin down
’till the floor was all white. I didn’t like to say anything
for fear of hurtin his feelings but I got mighty nervous.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We had been on the way about an hour when he
spied some oranges in a store we was passin, and he got
out, went in and took them. Didn’t stop to pay, just
took them and came out. The store keeper came out
and said, politely, that he had forgotten to pay, but Snow
White flew into a rage and began to swear frightful.
He pulled out his sword and chased the store keeper into
his store. Then we drove on, but by this time Dad and
I were scared stiff. About an hour later we passed
through Swedesboro when a little fellow with a star on
his coat came up and told us we were his prisoners.
The Spaniard jumped out and ran at him with the
sword. The constable was plucky; he pulled out a pistol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and fired at the Spaniard, but he didn’t hit him, and
the Spaniard chased him a ways down the road. We
drove on then but more scared than before. I asked the
Spaniard if he wasn’t afraid of being put in jail but he
said no, they wouldn’t dare touch a hidalgo.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Pretty soon we came to a cross road and somebody
yelled at us from a clump of bushes ‘Surrender in the
name of the law.’ But that didn’t frighten him. He
just jumped out and charged that clump and drove the
two men in it down the road. By this time we were
almost to Pennsgrove. I was so scared that I got off
and ran down a side street and Dad after me. We didn’t
see any more of him but we was told he drove in as
large as life and met the Sheriff, with two deputies. He
chased them and cut one of them pretty bad. Then he
ran to the wharf, jumped on a fishing boat, cut the cable
and started down the river. The revenue cutter got
after him and they fired a shot at the boat. This made
her fill and she went down but they managed to pull him
out. Of course he got very wet. They took him to
the jail, gave him some dry clothes and put him in a
cell. They captured Dad and me too, but after they had
asked us a lot of questions they concluded we wasn’t
to blame and let us go. I went to see the Spaniard next
day and, say, he was a sight! All the white scales was
gone but they had been thicker in some places than in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>others, and where they had been thickest there was a
kind of a pit on his face like a man who had small pox.
He looked fierce, but the water had made him look like
glass again. There was no snow white stuff on him
at all.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They took him before a J. P. that day and he told
them he was a Spanish nobleman who was willing to die
for Spain. He said he had sunk many English ships and
killed many English and that he was going to do it some
more.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now, I don’t know what you think,” Euphemia said
to me, “but I think that fellow had been thrown overboard
from some ship and was petrified on the bottom
of the sea and covered with sand. When you dug him
up he just came to life again. He must have been a
bird when he was alive, and so he just went on being a
bird when he came back to life.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, the Justice of the Peace thought he must be
crazy so he sent him to the asylum. But he didn’t stay
there long. He broke loose one night, made for the
shore, killed two men who was sleepin in a small vessel,
pulled up the anchor and put to sea and hasn’t been
heard of since.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch_2' class='c010'>Peep-Chick Mountain</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>Over in that funny state called New Jersey there is a
mountain called Peep-Chick Mountain, or something like
that, and this is the story of how it got the name:</p>

<p class='c015'>There was once a band of robbers who lived in a cave
on the side of this big mountain. They stole sheep and
pigs and chickens from the farmers who lived in the
valley. Once they had no bread, and the chief robber
said: “Go and steal all the eggs you can find and we will
trade them for bread at the store.<a id='tn012a'></a>” So they all went out to
steal eggs except one. He was a red-headed robber and
he said: “I think I am for Direct Action. I don’t believe
in this roundabout business of stealing eggs and
then trading them for bread. Besides I should like to
have some pie and cake also.” So he went down to the
road and hid in some bushes.</p>

<p class='c015'>Pretty soon a big automobile came whishing by. “Go
along whisher!” said the robber, “I can’t eat you.”
Then a truck came rumbling by. “Get along, rumble
bumble,” said Red Head. Then along came a baker’s
cart. “Hi!<a id='tn012b'></a>” said Reddy, “Here’s the Staff of Life!” So
saying, he pulled out his pistol and fired at the tire.
There was a bang and rattle, just as if a pane of glass
had fallen on the sidewalk, and the baker’s cart began to
wabble and pound on the road. “Ho!” said the baker’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>boy who was driving, “there goes a tire.” He got down
and went around the car. Just then Reddy came rushing
up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hands up for pie!” said he.</p>

<p class='c015'>The baker’s boy was so frightened that he ran and
jumped into the canal, swam across and hid behind some
trees. The robber fired several shots after him but they
only splashed the water and scared the boy. Then Reddy
unfastened a bag which had been wrapped around him
and shoved in pies, cakes, loaves of bread and doughnuts
as fast as he could. When this was full he filled another
bag. Then he tied the two together, flung them over his
back and made off as fast as he could.</p>

<p class='c015'>Presently the watchman spied Red Head coming up the
hill with his bags of pies, bread, cake and doughnuts.
It was misty and he loomed through the fog like a donkey
carrying sacks.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hey, Jack!” called the watch, “Ohe, Ohe!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ohe yourself!” said Red Head fetching him a slap
over the head. But he struck hard and lost his balance,
fell and rolled down the hill. The other robbers rushed
out and grabbed him, but soon discovered that it was Red
Head and let him go.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know what your eggs will look like,” said the chief.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they turned the bags inside out they found the
pies, cake, doughnuts and bread all mashed together.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>There was blackberry pie making a red streak and lemon
custard making a yellow streak, with doughnuts flattened
out and loaves of <a id='tn014'></a>bread between. The juice of the pies
had been soaked up by the bread and cake.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hey!” said the chief, “What have we here?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That,” said Reddy, “is pie-cake-doughnut-bread.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It looks it,” said the chief, “but I believe we can eat
it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So they sat down and ate some; and, sure enough, it
was good.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the meantime the other robbers who had gone out
had stolen all the eggs they could find and put them in
another cave near by. There were 503 dozen in all.
Now it happened that there was a hot spring in one
corner of the cave where the eggs were stored and after
they had lain there long enough they began to hatch out.
One morning when the robbers came out of their cave
they heard a great rustling and peeping all over the hillside.
There were 5798 peeps moving through the grass
and among the trees and crying: “peep! peep!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Goodness!” said the robber chief, “look at our eggs!
they are hungry.”</p>

<p class='c015'>That night they stole a feed grinder from a farmer
in the valley and several bags of corn. Three robbers
shelled corn, three drove the mill, three fed the corn and
three made mush of the meal and fed it to the peeps.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>The other robbers stole the corn and carried it up the
mountain. In about two weeks they were tired out.
“We are not robbers any longer,” they said, “this is
work!” so they all ran away. By this time the peeps had
become chicks and begun to eat grasshoppers and crickets
and were able to take some care of themselves; but the
foxes, weasels, skunks and minks had a fine time eating
them as they scattered over the mountain side. Bye
and bye the farmers caught them until there were no
more left; but the mountain is called Peep-Chick, or
something like that, to this day.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h2 id='ch_3' class='c010'>Round Valley</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>They called it Round Valley because it really was
round, hemmed in by very high hills, except on the west;
here there was an opening through the hills, down the
middle of which flowed a mill stream which drained the
valley. Part way down the gap between the hills was a
mill dam; and a short distance below the dam was the
mill. The miller was a little Gnome who lived in the
mill with his wife and daughter. The mother had once
been beautiful, but hard work had made her old before
her time. Her face was wrinkled; there were <a id='tn016'></a>crow’s
feet in the corners of her eyes; her steps were slow and
feeble and her hair was growing gray.</p>

<p class='c015'>The daughter was a very beautiful and charming girl;
she was happy-hearted. She moved around quickly,
helping her mother wash the dishes, sweep the floor,
put wood on the fire, take up the ashes, milk the cow
and feed the pigs and chickens. As she did these things
she often smiled, and anyone who took the trouble to
watch her could easily see that she had happy thoughts.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were many Little People living in this valley.
You seldom saw them but often heard them. In one
place below the mill the water fell over some rocks, and
here, if you listened, you could hear some of them saying:
“Urgle, urgle, urgle,” just as plain!</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Some lived in the branches of the pines and cooed:
“Whoo, whoo, whoo,” and others called from the dry
grass: “<a id='tn017'></a>z-z-z.” Everywhere their voices could be heard,
but very soft and low—for they were Little People.</p>

<p class='c015'>Every day the Gnome worked in the mill—pouring
grain into the hopper, tying up the bags of flour and
writing in a big book in one corner of the mill. His
clothes were always full of flour, and though he banged
them with his hands and shook himself before going into
the house, he was always gray or white. He was always
busy, and seldom came into the house except for meals;
but he appeared to be interested in his work and quite
cheerful.</p>

<p class='c015'>One evening the sky became dark earlier than usual,
and a mist fell over the valley; then the wind rose and
the rain began to fall. It was a dismal night out of
doors, but within the miller’s house it was bright and
cheerful. The window panes shone in the light from
the bright fire burning in the fireplace; the curtains over
the windows drooped gracefully and were clean and
white; there was a bookshelf filled with new books with
golden titles and a shelf filled with flowers in pots in one
of the windows. The room was clean and dry and warm
as the miller and his wife and daughter sat down to their
evening meal.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>As they sat eating and talking there came a knock at
the door and the daughter went to open it. A dark-eyed
Stranger was standing on the threshold. “Come in
quickly,” said the girl, “the wind is driving the dead
leaves and the rain into the house. You are very welcome;
come and share our meal!”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Stranger muttered his thanks and drew a chair
to the fire. The mother went upstairs and presently came
down again. “You are very wet,” said she. “I have
laid out a suit of my husband’s in the room above. Go
up and put it on! It will keep you warm and dry until
your own is ready.” So saying she opened the door of
the stairway and stood aside to allow the Stranger to
pass.</p>

<p class='c015'>In a short time he came down and ate a hearty meal;
but his face was far from cheerful. He appeared to
be gloomy and glum; he said little and looked at no one.
“He is tired,” said the mother to her husband, “take him
up to the guest room!”</p>

<p class='c015'>In the morning the visitor appeared to be more cheerful
than before. He was still gloomy and glum, however,
as he ate his breakfast. He had come down late and the
miller had gone to his work in the mill. The mother
was in the kitchen, and the daughter sang as she waited
on him, poured water on the flowers and drew back the
curtains to let more light into the room.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“Why are you sad?” said she, “see what a beautiful
morning! The fleecy clouds are sailing over the hills;
the mill stream is shouting for joy and the birds are singing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why should I be happy?” said he, “My wife and
child are dead; I am not well and I have lost my money.
Why should I rejoice?” So saying he looked gloomier
and glummer than before.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, you poor man,” said the girl, “I am so sorry.”
So saying she brought in another plateful of hot cakes
and put a jugful of maple syrup on the table; but still
she kept on singing, for her heart was filled with joy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is very pleasant here,” said the Stranger. “If you
do not mind I will stay a few days. I have enough
money left to pay my board.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You must settle that with my mother,” said the girl.
“It is rather lonesome here sometimes, but you will be
very welcome to stay as long as you like.” So saying she
ran off to tell her mother. “Oh, mother!” said she, “I
think it will be splendid to have him here; he is so sad;
and he has lost his wife and child and his money; and
his health is poor, too. I am <i>so</i> sorry for him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That is too bad,” said her mother, “We must be good
to him and perhaps he will become more cheerful.”</p>

<p class='c015'>At first the Stranger wandered up and down the
stream, hunting in the woods or fishing in the brook.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Presently he tired of this and began to help the miller.
Very soon he spent most of his time in the mill. In the
evening he and the daughter would sometimes take a
walk through the woods or over the hills. As he worked
in the mill and grew tired and hungry, and slept in the
clean, sweet country air, lulled by the voices of the Little
People, he grew stronger and happier; the frown left his
brow; he began to smile, and presently to hum a tune.</p>

<p class='c015'>One day the miller did not feel very well, and he went
to lie down on his bed, leaving the mill in charge of the
Stranger. A few days later this happened again. Presently
the Gnome laid down every day, and then he became
so weak that he must stay in bed all day, while the
Stranger took care of the mill alone. They sent for the
Doctor who said he must stay in bed until he got better.
But he got no better; he grew worse each day. One day
he called the Stranger to him and said: “I feel very
sick, and I believe I shall soon be going to a far country;
will you take care of my wife and daughter when I am
gone?” “Yes,” said the Stranger, “I will do all I can.
You have all been good to me and I will do my best to
return your kindness.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then the old miller turned his face to the wall and
died. And they buried him beneath the whispering pines.
And the daughter said: “Oh, what shall I do? What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>shall I do?” “Let me help you bear it,” said he. Then
she looked at him and smiled through her tears.</p>

<p class='c015'>After the miller died the mother was very lonely, and
she often said that she would like to go to him. Presently
she, too, sickened. Every day she grew worse, and
finally she died and was laid to rest beneath the spreading
pines beside her man.</p>

<p class='c015'>After the funeral they sat before the fireplace. She
was crying and his eyes were wet. “What can I do?”
said she, “I have no one to love me and care for me.”
“Yes you have,” said he, “I promised your father I would
take care of you, and I love you very much. It will not
be hard work for me to love you and care for you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh,” said she, “I am so glad you love me, I have
loved you for a long time.” Then she kissed him, shyly.</p>

<p class='c015'>In a few days they were married. She cared for the
house and he ran the mill. She is a good housewife and
sings as she works and he is a good miller and sings as
he runs the mill. They often kiss. I have noticed that
when he kisses her he grows younger but as she kisses
him she grows older. They grow happier every day.</p>

  <h2 id='ch_4' class='c010'>Mont L’Hery</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>To Angelo Catto, Archbishop of Vienna, from Philip
de Comines, Lord of Argenton:—</p>

<p class='c015'>In the Memoirs which I have written, my good Lord
Archbishop, at your desire, I have spoken of an occurrence
of little importance, it may appear, and which was
of small note among the great and mighty events which
took place then and thereafter. None the less, though
I have there written but a few words, (as thinking the
relation of my own small affairs of little value) matters
of great import to me and mine transpired which I shall
here set forth, that you may, if you see fit, relate them to
my dear daughter, Joan, when I am no more.</p>

<p class='c015'>In these Memoirs I have related that after the battle
of Mont l’Hery the horse I bestrode was old and tired,
which thrusting by accident his head into a bucket of
wine, drank it and was thereby become lustier and more
serviceable than he was before. I have also there set
down that on the third day after the battle we took up
our quarters in the village of Mont l’Hery and that the
inhabitants were in such consternation at our approach
that they fled, some into the church steeple, and some
into the castle, which held out against us and was not
taken.</p>

<p class='c015'>I have not set down the events of the first and second
days after the battle because, as you shall see, I could
not know much of them, being away on my own affairs.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>After I had mounted this old, tired horse which I had
ridden for several days, I laid the reins upon his neck
as was my wont. Straightway he began to gallop, and
when I sought to rein him in I found the bit between
his teeth, and he on a mad run. We burst through the
ranks of the men-at-arms, whereat I suffered not a little,
being without armour at the time, and galloped hard
into the village. As we turned at the church my old
horse stumbled and fell and I was thrown violently into
a meadow at one side of the way.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of what happened next I know only as it was related
to me thereafter. For a long time, it appeared, my wits
were wandering. Then I opened my eyes to look into
the eyes of a young maid bending over me anxiously.
She smiled and said: “I am glad, good sir. You were
as one dead. It was an ugly fall.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where am I?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You are in the house of my aunt’s nurse,” she replied.
“She lies sick in the room above. I had come to
visit her and saw you fall. I fear some of the King’s
men saw you also and will do you a mischief.” With that
there came a <a id='tn023'></a>knocking at the door and hoarse voices
shouting: “Open in the King’s name!”</p>

<p class='c015'>She opened the door and I heard loud voices talking.
Three archers were there, sent, they said, to bring me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the Castle, but the maid denied them. She averred I was
in great pain and unfit to be moved. There was much
said that I did not fully hear (my wits not yet being
fully returned), but presently she closed the door and
came back.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have staved them off for awhile,” she said, “but you
must get back your wits as soon as may be, for they will
come again.” But I was in a maze at the beauty of her
and said no word. She seemed like an angel to my
sleepy eyes; for by now I felt dead tired and of a mind
to sleep. This she saw and said: “Sleep, fair Sir! I
will fend them from you.” At which I dropped off to
sleep to dream of yellow-haired angels singing; and when
I awoke, of a truth she was singing in the chamber above.
In a few minutes she returned quietly and, seeing I was
awake, said: “I have now two patients, fair Sir, I pray
you tell me how you do?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I am stronger,” I replied “but my arm pains me, and
methinks a bone may perchance be broken.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not so,” said she, “but it is much bruised.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Again there was a knocking at the door, and when she
opened a rough voice enquiring for me.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He has been sleeping and is better, but he has been
much bruised and must stay the night.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nay, Nay!” said the archer, “<a id='tn024'></a>that must not be. I am
bidden to bring him straight to the Castle.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“He is my patient,” she replied, “and I tell thee I will
not have him moved, Count or no Count.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You must even have your way, Lady,” said he, “But I
see a heavy reckoning to be paid if he come not soon.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I will answer,” said she.</p>

<p class='c015'>When she returned: “I am beholden to you, Lady,”
I said, “for your too great kindness. But I must not
lead you into danger. That would be a poor return. Let
me be led to the Count.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How say you?” she replied, “would you put your head
in the noose? I tell you the Count is bitterly angry with
the Count de Charolois and will hang all his men.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I care not,” said I, “I will not see you led into danger
through my fault;” so saying, I sought to rise but fell
back almost fainting.</p>

<p class='c015'>“See,” said she, “was I not right? You are unfit to
go, and I will not have you go until you are fit!” Here
her eyes flashed and she stamped her little foot fiercely.</p>

<p class='c015'>I slept but poorly that night and a fierce fever consumed
me. In the morning she was much distressed and
vowed again I should not be moved. Shortly there came
another knock and a voice saying:</p>

<p class='c015'>“You little vixen! What matter if he die of a fever
or be hanged?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hanged he may be,” she replied, “<a id='tn025'></a>and you will, but he
must come to his trial well. And you do force him to it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>I shall have your own head sooner or later, and that I
vow!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I warn you the King shall hear of this!” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let him,” she said, “and let him do his worst. I have
cared for many wounded, and I have yet to ask whether
they be rich or poor, or of high or low degree.”</p>

<p class='c015'>’Tis said the Count was in awe of his Countess and of
her niece, my nurse. However this may be I know not.
I do know that I was not more disturbed that day.</p>

<p class='c015'>On the morrow I was still feverish having passed but
a poor night. In the morning she visited me again, saying:
“Fair Sir, I see but one way by which I may save
you from that murderer at the Castle. He is my uncle,
and were you but husband of mine he dare not touch
you. Have you a mind to wed?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Verily, this I had not thought of, but the thought left
me warm and not cold. And yet I must hesitate for her
sake. I dare not lest she regret. So I said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Truly, my Lady, the honor you speak of is far beyond
my just deserts. Did I think you truly willing I should
hurry on the match. But should you regret, nothing
would be left for me but death. Let me therefore die
the death at the hand of this dread Count rather than
you should grant so great a boon and then repent.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Say no more,” said she. “I have said you shall not
be harmed, and by God’s word no harm shall befall you.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>So saying, without more ado, she sent for the priest who
said mass and married us.</p>

<p class='c015'>Great was the wrath of the Count, her uncle. But
what was done could not be undone. When he was gone
she turned her face to me in shame. “What must you
think of me?” she said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you will but trust me,” said I, “you will see that
I think well of you. Before that you thus sacrificed your
future for me I thought you an angel. My life shall be
devoted to winning and keeping your love.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How do you know I do not love you now?” said she—and
fled.</p>

<p class='c015'>When our army came up and I was well again she had
disappeared. I saw her no more for months, being detained
from pursuing her by the war which came to an
end but slowly. After that I had served King Louis at
Peronne and had been taken into his service I heard
much of her, but do what I would, could never come near
her. At last, despairing, I went to the King and confessed
my plight and sought his Majesty’s assistance.
“What would you?” said the King.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do but let me see her, your Majesty,” said I, “that I
may at least have speech of her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That I will do right gladly,” said he.</p>

<p class='c015'>About a week thereafter I was sent for to the Royal
Cabinet and entering found the King with my wife.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“Did I not promise to bring you together?” said the
King. “Take now thy wife, de Comines and teach her
her duty. You may withdraw!”</p>

<p class='c015'>I offered my hand to my Lady and we withdrew to an
antechamber. Here she would fain have left me, but I
said: “Lady I am your humble slave. Will you not
listen to me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nay,” said she, “I have said and done unmaidenly
things and I am ashamed. Let me withdraw.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not so,” said I, “your acts were acts only of pity
which I would fain turn into acts of love if you will only
listen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Men speak well of you,” said she, “they tell me you
are kind of heart and merciful and will spare my shame.
But I ask not for pity. I will not be companion to a man
who does not love me without pity, that I may be triumphant
and without shame.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That you may well be,” said I, “if you will but listen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is not ears but eyes shall convince me,” said she.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Set me any task,” said I.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nay,” she replied, “let me but see you. Do not pursue
me. Let me see you in your daily work. I am to be
Lady in Waiting to the Queen, and I may see you thus.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You are harsh,” said I, “What have I done to be
treated so unkindly?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“I will not listen,” said she, stopping her ears with her
fingers and running away.</p>

<p class='c015'>For weeks thereafter I was condemned to see her daily
but scarcely to speak to her. The King and Queen
sought to throw us together but failed because she would
not. At last I despaired. I went to the King and asked
that I might be allowed to depart to my estate in Flanders
so that I need no longer be on the rack. To this the
King replied: “Do but let me speak to her again!” to
which I gave consent.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next day I was sent for again to the King’s
Cabinet, and entering found her again. “Why will you
not put an end to this severity?” said the King, turning
to her. “The poor fool pines daily. He loses flesh. He
sulks. He is as one distraught. Mend him or break him,
but torture him no longer.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He is my own husband,” said she, her eyes flashing
defiance.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Surely,” said the King, “treat him therefore as a man
and not as a dog. Now leave me. I am weary of your
quarrel.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Again we departed; as we reached the anteroom she
whispered: “May I not do as I please with you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You may indeed,” said I, “<a id='tn029'></a>but trample no longer upon
my heart, I beseech you.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“Thou art but a poor fool,” said she, “why not make
me be good since I have loved thee from the first? Do
I not love thy eyes and thy curly hair and thy straight
back and even thy coat and hat. Surely I love thee, thou
blind goose!”—and fled again. But this time I was too
quick. I caught her and I have held her ever since, and
with her good will as she declares and I believe. She
has been my willing slave and I hers. Hath any man
ever had a more devoted mate? Did she not visit me
each day I spent in the iron cage at Loches? In rain, in
fog, in sleet, in sunshine; still she came, and she is mine
and I am hers, forever.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h2 id='ch_5' class='c010'>Death Valley</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>Away out in California, near the Nevada line, lies a
lonely valley. No one lives in this valley very long; it is
a very lonesome place. In the winter the thermometer
goes down below freezing point at night and rises to
eighty degrees during the day. This is the pleasant time
of year. In the spring and fall violent wind storms sweep
over the desert, for it is a desert—the Mohave Desert—and
in the summer the hot wind blows, drying up every
drop of moisture and baking the country as if it had
been placed in a baker’s oven. The few who must stay
there get a leather-like skin from the heated wind and
the glaring sun, with never a cloud to hide its pitiless
rays. Sagebrush and greasewood are found here and
there, and in the infrequent river bottoms a few willows
are seen. Fissure springs, from deep faults in the earth’s
crust let out small streams of water from sources far
remote; sometimes fit to drink; sometimes loaded with
salts in solution and sometimes hot. Such a spring is
that which gives rise to Willow Creek which rises among
the niter hills of the Great Basin and empties into the
Amargosa River a short distance below its source. Alas
for the name! The Amargosa “River” turns out on examination
to be a stream scarce large enough to turn a
mill. After a run of less than 25 miles it sinks into the
sands to rise no more. Shortly below this place we find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Saratoga Springs and “Lakes.” These “Lakes” are perhaps
10 feet in diameter. All along the banks of the
Amargosa the water as it evaporates rapidly in this
thirsty land leaves a white crust of salt, soda and borax.
In many places, scattered over the desert, deposits of
mixed salts have been left by evaporated water which
glisten in the sun from a distance. As the weary traveler
walks through them the alkali rises in fine white clouds
burning throat and nostril and biting the skin into sores.</p>

<p class='c015'>Over this desert roams the dismal coyote—always
hungry, an <a id='tn032'></a>Ishmaelite. Kangaroo rats swarm in rocky
spots; the side-winder threads his snaky way; and lizards
and tarantulas scuttle to their holes to escape the traveler.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1849 the Bennett family wandered into this valley
and perished, giving to the valley its name. All along the
wagon tracks—for there are no roads—bottles, tin cans
and the skeletons of abandoned animals mark the progress
of civilization and the survival of the fittest. It is
a weary land; over 400 feet below sea level; bounded
by the black rocks of the Funeral Range on the northeast,
the Kingston Range on the north, the Shadow
Mountains on the southeast, the Avawatz Mountains on
the south and the Telescope Range on the west. These
mountains rise in some places to a height of 10,000 feet.
The springs are far apart, from 30 to 90 miles, often with
a very small flow and hard to find. At Cave Wells, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>example, the traveler in search of water goes into a hole
in the side of a cliff and descends a few steps to the
margin of a shallow pool with no apparent overflow.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c015'>“When does your uncle come for you, Jack?” said
her friend.</p>

<p class='c015'>“To-morrow morning,” Jack replied.</p>

<p class='c015'>Next morning her friend was getting breakfast when
a knock sounded on the door. When the door was
opened, a wiry, pale-faced man stood in front of her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where is Jack’s kid?” he enquired.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Upstairs in bed,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c015'>Without a word he brushed by her, mounted the stairs,
opened the door, bent over the half-awakened girl, put
his arms around her and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is your name Jack, too?” he enquired. “You are a
mighty nice-looking boy and I will love you and look
after you for his sake. Now I must go. We will leave
for the west at 10 to-morrow morning. I am ordered to
the desert to spend the winter there in the out of doors
for the sake of my health. Get yourself a corduroy
suit with high-laced boots. Here is some money. I will
be here for you at nine-thirty. Good bye till then!” So
saying, he turned, rushed down the stairs and out of the
house.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Did you ever see such a whirlwind?” said Jacqueline.
“He thinks I am a boy, and he will be disappointed
and not let me go. What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Go as a boy,” said her friend. “You are slim and can
easily pass as a boy. I will help you get ready. Come
along!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Next morning when Uncle appeared Jack was ready,
dressed in corduroy knickers, stout, high-laced shoes,
short, thick corduroy coat and felt hat.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, come along!” said Uncle, “We have just time
to make the train.”</p>

<p class='c015'>At Salt Lake City they outfitted for the desert. Five
burros were bought, two for riding and three for packing.
Jack’s burro was called Jenny. Jenny was a canny
animal. She grunted at every step. Her progress might
in some measure be likened to that of a drove of pigs,
except that her grunts lacked the solidity and conviction
which characterize the grunt of the real porker. Mexico
is the real land of the burro. Here they are used to such
an extent as freighters as to threaten the existence of
the railroads. The Mexican will load his burros to their
full capacity and at the stopping places let them graze.
No food is provided except what they can pick up. If
there should be no food and the animal starves he buys
another since this is the cheapest plan.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>They carried a light rifle and two Colt’s revolvers, or
“Guns” as they are called in the west. There was a tent,
two blankets, a bucket, a frying pan, two large canteens,
a spade, pick, axe, plenty of coffee and tea, canned baked
beans, hard bread, bacon, butter and lard, some flour and
feed for the burros.</p>

<p class='c015'>Neither one could bake or shoot but Uncle remarked
that there would be time enough to learn and plenty of
teachers. Notwithstanding his quick and sometimes
almost rough manner, Jack soon discovered that Uncle
was growing fond of her and was really very kind. At
first she was very tired as night drew near after a hard
day’s riding over the rough trails. They went slowly of
necessity, for the burro is not a fast goer and dislikes
hurry to an extreme. As the days went by she found
her strength growing. He, too, appeared to benefit.
They ate plain food, drank nothing but water, and
coffee or tea, and retired early and slept soundly. Occasionally
they stopped at a settlement, ate a square meal,
renewed supplies, had a bath and made ready for another
trip.</p>

<p class='c015'>In this way the winter passed rapidly. Jack learned
to shoot, and, profiting from the directions of a good-natured
miner, after several failures, they learned to
make fair bread.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Jack’s greatest trouble was her cowardice, because she
felt sure her Uncle would detest in a boy what he might
condone knowing her to be a girl. She made desperate
efforts and finally succeeded in controlling her fears
moderately well. The dislike she had for shooting was
never overcome.</p>

<p class='c015'>Most of all she enjoyed the evenings by the camp fire
when the exertions of the day had not been so great as
to compel early hours. Here she looked into his heart
and found it clean and good.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were plenty of indications that all the men one
might meet were not of his kind. Bottles innumerable
left along the way testified to the fact that though the
desert might be dry the travelers were not.</p>

<p class='c015'>They traveled down the post road from Milford to
Delmar and from there struck across country, intending
to cross the Hiko, Paranaga and Belted Ranges and
strike the Amargosa Desert to the south. These ranges
cover a very rough and broken country, and progress
was slow and difficult. Several times they were lost,
and only the compass finally enabled them to escape from
the mountain tangle. The greatest difficulty was in the
supply of water for the burros. Their own supply could
easily be carried. Several times the burros were saved
from death by the finding of one or two barrel cactus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>which were cut up and fed to them as both food and
drink.</p>

<p class='c015'>With all his good nature Uncle made her toe the mark.
He did not believe in spoiling boys. They were generally
lazy and he was determined Jack should do her full
share of the work, but he did not always remember this.
Being naturally lazy she resented being driven. She
much preferred to lie around and read, or to lie abed and
see him get breakfast, but he usually routed her out. He
was anxious that she should grow strong and made her
work in order that she might do so but uncomplainingly
and as a matter of course he shouldered the heaviest part
of the load. It may be imagined, therefore, that her
regard for Uncle grew greater day by day. There was
bread to make and he made it; the water grew short and
he went without; the burros strayed and he went after
them,—not grudgingly but without complaint. She had
heard of him through her father’s talks many and many
a time. She had learned of his goodness to her father;
and here he was, unselfishly giving to her all he could
give, freely and as a matter of course. Such conduct
makes a friend of any generous-minded soul. It slowly
converted her regard into devotion. She began to look
for opportunities to serve him. To do anything for him
became a joy.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>They were nearing the Amargosa and were sitting at
the camp fire one evening when he said: “Jack, you are
the very nicest boy I ever knew. I thought your father
was the finest man on earth but I have lost him forever.
I have found you instead. I am selfish and I would like
to have you both; but, oh, my dear boy! I am so glad
to have found you.” Jack said nothing but she turned
her face to conceal the tears.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had been many days on the road. That afternoon
they crossed the Funeral Range into Death Valley.
The rocks of this range are black, rough, crumbly and
forbidding. It is a bad climbing ground for the rocks are
rotten and afford very insecure support. As they were
slowly and painfully groping their way down into the
valley a rock upon which he was standing gave way and
he came sliding down in an avalanche of stones and dirt.
She saw at a glance that he was headed for a precipice
and without hesitating a second threw herself in the way.
He was stopped but she slid many feet, turning over
and over and landed against another rock, just on the
edge of the precipice, covered with stones and dirt.
Hastily he tore the spade from the pack, rushed down
and uncovered her. Her coat was torn and her shirt in
rags. She was unconscious as he laid her on the ground
and cleaned the dirt from hands and face and gave her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>water to drink. Slowly she came out of the daze to find
him anxiously bending over her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Were you hurt?” said she.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” he replied, “see whether any of your bones are
broken.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They camped at Saratoga Springs and from there
traveled by easy stages to Daggett and thence to Los
Angeles. All the way he was quiet, and she viewed him
with apprehension. On the way east he sat beside her in
the Pullman.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why did you not tell me you were a woman?” said
he.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I was afraid you would not take me, and I wanted to
go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, it’s too bad. I suppose now I must send you
off to live with <a id='tn039'></a>some one else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Please don’t do that Uncle, I couldn’t bear it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What can I do then? Get my sister to live with us?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why yes, I suppose so. There are evil tongues. We
must have some one.”</p>

<p class='c015'>His sister saw at once that she must play the rôle of
huckleberry, and felt no great eagerness, but good-naturedly
consented at last, firmly resolved to aid fate
as much as possible so that she might go back to her own
work.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The play began with taking them to the theatre twice
a week when sister was careful that Jack should sit next
to brother. It continued by taking them to the country
for the summer. Then they came back to the city again
and missed the long walks and the pleasant companionship
of the afternoons with nothing to do but exchange
ideas. Then Uncle was called to Chicago on business
for a week. This lengthened to two weeks. On returning
he was so glad to see her that he kissed her and she
impulsively returned the kiss and fled. How could a
lonesome bachelor long resist such a combination of
youth, beauty and love. There was a quiet wedding soon
in which two hearts as well as two hands were united.
They are not lovers, they are chums. He knows her
thoughts and she his—they like each other.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>
  <h2 id='ch_6' class='c010'>The Professor’s Story</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>When I was in college one of my professors was a
rather old man who was fond of telling about his
travels. He told me about several trips he had taken.
Some of these stories were very interesting, for he had
gone into many places outside the tourist’s ordinary
routes in order to study subjects in which he was particularly
interested. One of these trips was a visit to
Rome. It was taken to attend a Congress of Chemists
that assembled there in the Palace of Justice, or Palazzo
de Giustitia as the Italians call it, located on the right
bank of the Tiber near the Castel de <a id='tn041'></a>St. Angelo. His
daughter, a beautiful girl of 21, accompanied him on the
trip. They traveled on the Red Star Line to Vlissingen,
or Flushing, and up the Scheldt to Antwerp.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Congress was held in term time and he was
limited to an absence of six weeks. There were two
things which he particularly wished to see during this
time. One of them was the iron mines of Elba. The
ores found in these mines are hematites and contain some
of the finest crystals of hematite that have ever been
discovered. Elba was also, you will remember, the home
of Bonaparte after he had been expelled from France for
the first time. Here he ruled in petty state from the
fifth of May, 1814, to the twenty sixth of February, 1815.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The second, and indeed the chief, object of his trip
was to see the boracic acid <i>soffioni</i> at Lardrello. Here,
it had been stated, jets of steam break forth from the
earth in which small amounts of boracic acid are contained.
This steam is carried into water, the boracic acid
condensed with the steam, and the dilute solution thus
obtained evaporated at a low temperature so as not to
again volatilize it. Ammonia and sulfureted hydrogen
are also present and considerable amounts of ammonium
sulfate come into commerce from this source. These
statements which were so varied in character as to cause
some suspicion of exaggeration had aroused his curiosity,
only to be completely satisfied by <a id='tn042'></a>first-hand information
such as could be best obtained by a visit.</p>

<p class='c015'>From Antwerp they traveled to Brussels and from
there to Rome by express, by way of Milan. They expected
to find it warm in Italy and left their heavy clothing
at Antwerp to await their return. They traveled
through the Italian Alps, however, and suffered from the
cold until Rome was reached. The journey from
Brussels was begun in the evening and the second night
was passed on the way from Milan to Rome. No seats
together were to be had in the train from Milan. The
daughter found a good seat in the compartment reserved
for women where there was room also for her father
and where he joined her. Whenever the conductor came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>around he remonstrated with the Professor; but as the
latter was comfortably established this was met by a stare
of no comprehension and the slipping of a lira into the
conductor’s hand which ended the argument until the
next conductor came around when the process must be
repeated. It was, however, uniformly successful.</p>

<p class='c015'>They approached Rome on the afternoon of a beautiful
day in May. The whole surroundings were picturesque
in the extreme. Black masses of masonry perched
upon the hilltops, marking the sites of cities and towns,
spoke eloquently of the reign of lawlessness only just
passing away. They passed remains of tombs and
caverns excavated in the hillsides—the marks of past
civilizations. Everywhere, inside and outside of Rome,
were foundations of buildings of the oldest masonry upon
which a second structure had been erected, to be in
turn destroyed and serve as the foundation of another
erection, but still leaving visible remains. This was the
country and these the places where Julius and Augustus
Caesar lived and reigned, where Cicero spoke, where
Cataline conspired, over which Hannibal roamed at will
and where Fabian tactics were born. This was the land
of the two Plinies, of Scipio the conqueror of Carthage,
of Dante and Virgil; the sense of its antiquity grew and
became overpowering.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>They thought Italy the most beautiful country they
had ever seen, “Why,” said the Professor, “As we
traveled along I saw <i>Narcissus Poeticus</i> growing in the
fields.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They stopped at the Royal Hotel and were visited by
a valet who proposed that he should take care of them
during their stay, to which they assented. They occupied
three rooms, two bedrooms and a sitting room. In the
sitting room of a morning breakfast was prepared by the
valet while they were dressing. Then they sat down to
breakfast, the valet waiting on them. Lunch was served
downstairs, but dinner was the great event of hotel life.
The guests were expected to be on time but if delayed
they murmured a perfunctory excuse to the Major Domo
which was smilingly accepted. The cooking here was
elevated to the dignity of a fine art. It was marvelous
and sometimes spectacular; as when at the conclusion of
a meal an ice was placed in a dish and this in another
larger dish held high upon the waiter’s outstretched hand,
came in surrounded by blue flames, produced by pouring
a little strong liquor into the outer vessel and setting
fire to it. Upon another evening, after dinner, the guests
were entertained with a very wonderful musical performance
carried out by two men and a woman, the latter
a very beautiful and accomplished Italian. It soon dawns
upon the traveler that the modern Italian is descended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>from widely differing tribes, few of whom even look
alike. Those we know best are swarthy, with black hair
and wonderful eyes. There are many types beside this,
and not a few light skins and blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Congress was divided into sections. The presiding
officer of each section had been selected because of his
accomplishments as a linguist. This was necessary, because
there were four official languages in which papers
might be presented and discussed: Italian, French, German
and English. Two of the presiding officers were
Germans: Georg Lunge, an accomplished technical
chemist, who had been petted until his sense of proportion
had been lost and he had become arrogant, and
Wilhelm Ostwald, an equally accomplished and much
more learned man and a great physical chemist, who was
always polite and never was able to forget that he was a
gentleman, first. But the sessions were found uninteresting
by comparison. Rome itself was so absorbing.
They soon gave up the sessions entirely and devoted all
their time to exploring the city. The first trip was to
the Colosseum. Here they secured a guide—quite an
old man, with an English all his own—who declared that:
“He was a Roman citizen and p-r-r-r-oud of it.” The
Professor did not blame him in the least for this feeling.
The old man proved to be a wonderful mine of information,
most of it apparently accurate. He explained how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the naval battles and other water scenes were managed,
how the crowds were protected from the sun and from
rains, how the various orders of Romans came in and
reached their seats, and showed them the dens where
wild beasts were kept. In answer to a question as to
how the stones of the amphitheatre were joined without
mortar, he took them to a place where a broken
corner showed the method of joining by means of a short
iron rod leaded into both stones. While they were talking
and the Professor was sketching he turned his head
and found a policeman with sword and musket overlooking
the performance, and especially the sketching,
which it seemed was forbidden. But the guide set them
at ease by remarking, pointing to the <a id='tn046'></a>policeman: “a friend of
mine.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Another afternoon was devoted to the famous Forum
Romanum, the scene of so many speeches and so many
triumphs, and, especially remembered, the speech of
Antony over Caesar’s dead body, reported by Shakespeare,
and repeated and varied in interpretation by so
many of the masters of the tragic art.</p>

<p class='c015'>A third excursion was to the catacombs on the Appian
Way. They were greeted here by a priestly-looking
crowd of men one of whom enquired, pointing at them:
“English?” Answered in the affirmative they were
motioned aside until enough English had accumulated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>to make up a party and the burly and not over clean
guide led them around. The catacombs were disappointing.
The galleries are narrow, tortuous and unattractive.
The remains of the art of that period though no doubt
interesting as showing how art arose decayed and died,
were not interesting to a modern. The conclusion was
still more unattractive; for, on trying to find their conveyance
they discovered that it had disappeared and they
must find their way back afoot. But it was evening;
they were walking over the road so many conquerors
had trodden; under the soft Roman twilight with the
monuments of the great dead on both sides of the way;
they were glad the driver had fled and left them to walk.</p>

<p class='c015'>One day was stolen for a swift excursion to Naples
to see the museum. Here they stopped at Bertolini’s
Hotel, which is situated on the side of a hill far above
the city level, with a splendid view. This is reached by
going through a doorway into a tunnel at the end of
which is a lift. At the top a splendid hotel with this
superb view of the bay and of Vesuvius.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was not time for a thorough examination of the
treasures of the museum, but enough was seen to verify
and enlarge some statements the Professor had made in
a history he was then writing. The examples of metal
working were very illuminating, showing as they did in
some magnificent examples from Pompeii how little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>modern art excelled the art of that day except in speed
and cheapness of working.</p>

<p class='c015'>Returning to Rome they discovered that the trip to
Elba and to Lardrello had been abandoned because of a
strike among the employes on the railway and steamboat;
but the Professor declared that he had come to see Lardrello
and he would walk there if necessary. The next
day they started for Pisa. Most of the route lay along
the rocky coast of the Mediterranean through the most
beautiful scenery in the world. The road runs along a
shelf on the rocks with many tunnels. And the smoke!
Ah, the smoke! Oh, the smoke! It gets into the eyes,
the nose, the mouth, the ears, over the face and down the
back. There is no avoiding it and no escape is possible.
They arrived at Pisa about 11 P. M. and were met at
the hotel by the proprietor with the question: “You
would like a room?” “Yes, two rooms.” A shrug, and
then: “I do not know what I shall do; we have but two
rooms; one has three beds and the other four beds.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The answer is easy,” said the Professor, “My daughter
will take the room with three beds, I will take the
room with four beds.” When they were escorted to
the rooms by the proprietor, the head porter, the maid
and the facchini or porters and the doors were opened
on the overflowing hospitality of seven beds for two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>travelers, a hearty laugh broke from every throat; a
laugh is the same in all languages.</p>

<p class='c015'>Pisa is not very inspiring. The famous leaning tower
leans because the foundations were poor, and the <a id='tn049'></a>Baptistery
is built of old tombstones and other stolen pieces
of marble from which the thieves had not decency enough
to chisel away the inscriptions. This thievery seems
to have been a habit in the days which we see through
the fogs of romance.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next day they turned back and retraced their
steps for part of the way to Cecina where they transferred
to the road to Volterra. This town is situated on
the frowning heights above the railway station, where a
crowd of people; drivers, porters and others was assembled.
The Professor accosted a hack driver in English.
To this there was no reply but a shrug of the
shoulders. Then he tried German, French and Latin in
succession, all in vain. As they were about giving up
in despair a voice from behind them, or from Heaven,
said: “You would like to go to Lardrello? You are interested
in boracic acid?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have come all the way from America to see it,” said
the Professor, “so you may judge whether I am interested.”
Introductions followed and cards were exchanged.
Their friend was Prince Conti, son-in-law of
Count Lardrello and the manager of the works. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>told the driver what was required; gave him instructions
where to take the travelers for the night and what they
would like to eat and promised to meet them at the
works next day. He too, it seemed, had been attending
the Congress and was just returning.</p>

<p class='c015'>They traveled over a beautiful country covered with
olive orchards, with pale yellowish-green foliage, to a
country inn. Here everything was primitive and old-fashioned
to the last degree, but <i>clean</i>. There were tile
floors and the beds were of wrought iron in filagree,—beautiful
pieces of workmanship.</p>

<p class='c015'>Next morning they reached the works in a desolate
valley over which clouds of steam hovered. They were
met and welcomed by the Prince who apologized for not
being able to open the Palace for them as the family were
away and the servants dispersed for the summer.</p>

<p class='c015'>The natural <i>soffioni</i>, they discovered, had failed to give
a sufficient yield and were now supplemented by wells
sunk as are petroleum wells in Pennsylvania. One of
the new developments had been the striking of steam at
a pressure of sixty pounds in some of the wells. These
wells were capped and the steam led through a boiler containing
a purifying agent to remove the sulfureted hydrogen,
after which it was used to run a steam engine which
in turn actuated mills to grind the boracic acid and borax
produced. After going through the works the Prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>was good enough to present the young lady with a
bouquet of flowers and they said good-bye. The use of
steam from Mother Earth to run a steam engine was,
the Professor said, an entirely new idea not used, so far
as he knew, anywhere else in the world, and suggested
a possible method of keeping alive in those times we may
possibly expect as our fuels disappear. It may then be
necessary to drive deep wells to tap the supply of heat
now lying far below the surface in most places and only
reaching through the crust in a few.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>
  <h2 id='ch_7' class='c010'>My Friend Zahn</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>I am a very ordinary person with some rather remarkable
acquaintances. It is my purpose to give here some
account of these men and women—for they are of both
sexes—and incidentally to describe some of the remarkable
discoveries they have made.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was my good fortune to become well acquainted
with several of these personages—for they are remarkable
enough to be so called—while I was a student in a
mid-western college for both sexes. Being a man of
sufficient means and a bachelor with a taste for scientific
studies, I have had leisure to attend many scientific conventions;
and here I have been able to make the acquaintance
of many other persons of brain power and industry
sufficient to lead them to eminence. I flatter myself that
I have, by reason of an agreeable personality, obtained
an unusual knowledge of the work they have accomplished.
I will admit that some of these men and women
have a very limited supply of polished manners, and one
or two are almost without any of the qualifications necessary
in a member of polite society.—But this will develop
as the story progresses.</p>

<p class='c015'>I first met Samuel Zahn as a fellow freshman. His
was a most engaging personality, for he is kind, witty
and brainy. He took the lead in the class from the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>day in college and was the most popular member. Needless
to say he was at once chosen President of the class,
and President he remains to this day. He is over six
feet tall, with large limbs and a big head; since leaving
college he has gained weight and improved in appearance.
I visited him at his home in a large western city
five years ago and we spent several days together, talking
far into the nights; and during this time he had much
to say about various phases of his work in biology, of
which he is an enthusiastic student.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why is it Brown,” he enquired, “that all living beings
must grow old and die? This is true of all plants
and all animals. There must be some chemical reason
for this universal fact.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Before following out my line of reasoning, Brown,
perhaps I should first recall your attention to the method
of scientific discovery. We are accustomed, as you are
aware, when traveling into new ground to form first an
hypothesis as an explanation of the facts known to us.
Beginning with this hypothesis, we first reason out the
consequences which must follow if the hypothesis should
be the real explanation. We then proceed to test these
consequences by experiment. We then reason out other
necessary consequences of the hypothesis and proceed
further with our tests. If the results of our tests confirm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the hypothesis it presently becomes a theory and in
course of time a law.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have formed a great many hypotheses to account for
the ageing of plants and animals, but under the test of
experiment these have all broken down one after another.
Recently, however, it occurred to me that perhaps the
ageing might be due to the formation of resinous substances
in the tissues by the combination of two substances
one contained in the food the other in the tissues.
You will remember that the insoluble resin, bakelite, is
formed by the union of an aldehyde and a phenol
under suitable temperature conditions. If, now, the aldehyde
like body formed part of the tissue, and the phenol
were contained in the food and passed unchanged into
the circulation, we should have slow combination and
the formation of hard material—perhaps also material
in the form of fibers and therefore flexible—within the
tissues, which would cause them to harden and stiffen,
inducing the other changes we ascribe to old age.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If now these phenol bodies are contained in the plant
and animal juices constituting our foods they must be
contained in those that are short lived in largest amount,
and it should be possible to bring on old age much more
rapidly by feeding short lived plants. For this purpose
I used first oat straw, but I found this did not produce
the desired effect. On further consideration it seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>unlikely that it should: for the ripe, and therefore dead,
straw would contain only the resin and neither aldehyde
nor phenol. I therefore used green oat straw and found
that this brought on old age rapidly when fed to dairy
cows with no other food. I then tried various additions
to the green oat straw with the object of finding some
substance capable of uniting with and destroying the
phenol. This I have at last succeeded in finding; and
I am now in possession of a reagent which will so far
destroy any of these phenols contained in food, that old
age is indefinitely arrested. This as you will see places a
dreadful responsibility in my hands. This is not the
Secret of Perpetual Youth exactly, for I cannot so far
restore youth to the aged—I can only arrest decay. By
feeding this antidote to a baby it may remain a baby forever.
Or it may be allowed to reach any desired age and
then forced to cease developing indefinitely. I will confess
to you that I feel dismayed by this heavy responsibility.
What do you think I should do? What is my
duty?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is such an extraordinary story, Zahn,” I replied,
“that I think, in fairness, you should first give
some proof that you are not in error in thinking your discovery
a real one; and since considerable time must
necessarily pass before any satisfactory demonstration of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>this kind can be made perhaps we had better not further
discuss the matter at present.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Spoken with your usual clearheadedness,” he rejoined.
“I must confess, however to a certain amount
of disappointment in your lack of faith in accepting my
conclusions.”</p>

<p class='c015'>To this I made no rejoinder, thinking that the less the
subject was discussed the better.</p>

<p class='c015'>He then informed me that he had invited two friends
to lunch with us. “I am much interested in them,” he
said, “because I believe they are much interested in each
other. They are very interesting people, and I want
you to know them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Shortly before one they arrived. The man was approximately
about fifty years of age and rather above the
medium height; he was well-built and walked like a
soldier. His hair was only slightly gray; his nose was
straight and well-formed. There was about him a certain
air of gentility, and his manner was pleasant and courteous.
The lady was at least twenty years younger. She
was the most beautiful creature I had ever met, and her
manner was alert and full of charm. They came in together,
and there was no possibility of doubting their
interest in each other. But they were both so genuinely
interested in their host and in me that this mutual understanding
seemed pleasant to both of us. He was introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>as John Valient, a successful lawyer and she as
Helen Henderson.</p>

<p class='c015'>At table we were waited on by Mrs. Frains, Sam’s
housekeeper, a dear, motherly old lady with white hair,
kind eyes and a fair complexion. Sam introduced her to
us, and treated her as in every way an equal. Miss
Henderson sat at his right, Valient at his left and I opposite.</p>

<p class='c015'>During the meal Sam informed us that he had recently
given some attention to nutrition and had come to the
conclusion that condiments played a much more important
rôle than had hitherto been assigned to them. He
had studied these therefore with some attention and had
compounded one which he thought we would find very
agreeable. He proceeded to extract a bottle from a
near by closet; from a medicine dropper inserted through
the cork he dropped a single drop upon our fish.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is very strong,” he remarked, “and more than a
single drop would be too much. If you wish I will give
a bottle of it to each one of you provided you will
promise to use a single drop at each meal until it is all
used. According to my calculations this will take a
little over nine years, for there are 500 cubic centimeters
in the bottle and each cubic centimeter is equal to twenty
drops.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>After eating the fish, which was delicious, we readily
promised and received each a bottle. I may remark here
that I became very fond of the relish, and now, after the
lapse of five years, the bottle is nearly half full, thus
showing how accurate were his calculations.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wish,” said Miss Henderson to Zahn, “that you
would tell Mr. Brown about your agricultural catalysts.
I think this a very entertaining story.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why certainly,” he replied, “I shall be delighted.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You must know, Brown,” he said, addressing me,
“that there are a large number of chemical substances
which are called catalysts. I can best illustrate what this
means by giving two examples. If potassium chlorate be
heated it melts and begins to give off bubbles of oxygen
gas. If, however, we first pulverize the chlorate and
add to it a mere pinch of very finely powdered manganese
dioxid and mix the two very thoroughly and then
heat the mixture, oxygen will again come off but at so
low a temperature that the chlorate does not even melt,
and much more rapidly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“In the manufacture of ‘Crisco’ and other lard substitutes
from liquid oils by pumping hydrogen through
the oil in closed vessels, so long as only these two substances
are present no combination takes place and the
pressure increases. But if a small amount of finely divided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>nickel be added combination at once begins, the
melting point of the oil rises and the pressure falls.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We once supposed that many chemical substances
found in minute amount in the ashes of plants were not
of importance, but it has lately been asserted that this is
not true and that manganese in particular plays an important
part in plant economy, acting as a catalyst. I
have verified this fact and have proceeded to examine the
action of different manganese compounds in order to determine
which is most active. The acetate functions well,
the hydrosol better but colloidal manganese is by far
the best. In any considerable amount this acts as a
violent poison but in homeopathic doses it functions as a
vigorous stimulant. Using this reagent as a hypodermic
I have obtained astonishing results. I have one stalk of
Indian corn on my farm treated in this way which measures
forty feet in height and has seven ears, each over
a foot long and perfectly set, with grains well on toward
ripeness. Watermelons the size of hogsheads are readily
produced and we have canteloupes, cucumbers and tomatoes
as large as nail kegs. I have used the kohl rabi
for several years as a source of winter forage for my
cattle, slicing them before feeding. Treated in this way
heads as large as barrels are readily grown, as much as
forty tons per acre being an ordinary yield. I have in
consequence been able to quadruple the size of my herd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>without devoting more acreage to the growing of forage.
I have not entirely succeeded in increasing the oat and
wheat crop because of the difficulties in the way of successful
wholesale hypodermic injection. I have made a
somewhat promising beginning, however, by successfully
inoculating chrysanthemum with the aid of the aphis
which preys on them. You know that this aphis punctures
the outer cuticle with his proboscis and drinks the
sap. Acting on this knowledge I have first sprayed the
aphis with a dilute colloidal manganese and dried them
rapidly with a current of warm air. The colloid adheres
to the outside of their beaks and gently stimulates. When
the beak is inserted the plant at once is inoculated. The
aphis is then destroyed by the application of whale oil
soap or other appropriate insecticide and the plant develops
to an enormous size producing blossoms as large
as a lady’s summer straw hat. They are indeed marvelous.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have also begun some experiments upon animals
but the effect here seems to be even more poisonous.
Another idea has, however, occurred to me which gives
promise of a very great success. You know that caffein
is a mild stimulant to the human race, and acting on this
lead I have tried a number of stimulants, winding up
with virulent poisons. One of these containing arsenic
combined with strychnine, cocaine and selenium has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>injected into calves from my herd which are now, at six
weeks, as large as their mothers. Unfortunately this
growth has been accompanied by the development of a
disagreeable odor which makes them unpleasant neighbors.
I fear I shall be forced to find a substitute for the
selenium in order to avoid this but I have no doubt of
final success.”</p>

<p class='c015'>During this recital any conversation had become impossible;
in fact we were reduced to a state of coma and
walked from the table like well-trained somnambulists
without uttering a word.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the evening I accompanied Zahn to a lecture he was
to deliver before the Society of Facultative Anaerobists.
It appeared that these people had associated themselves
for the purpose of further studying those organisms
which develop either in an atmosphere of oxygen or of
one devoid of it. In the latter case they decompose some
substance contained in the solution and assimilate the
oxygen it contains. The lecture was to be delivered at
the society headquarters over a grocery store. The entrance
was on a side street in the rear. There was a
light over the entrance and the hall was gained by mounting
a steep pair of stairs. We found the assembled <a id='tn061'></a>anaerobists
busily at work under the chairmanship of a lanky
individual in corduroy trousers. Upon our entrance the
proceedings were at once suspended to allow the lecture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>to proceed. Zahn was escorted to the platform with
much deference and began as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Fellow Truthseekers:—It is with some hesitation
that I venture to appear before you to make my small
contribution to your proceedings. I am well aware of
the labors of some members of this illustrious society,
and feel considerable diffidence in appearing before you.
I shall confine my remarks to two themes: The first will
be a contribution to the technology of inoculation. I have
had considerable experience of the difficulty and danger
of inoculating savage animals, and the first part of my
paper merely describes the technique which I have found
successful in such cases. I have here an inconspicuous
gun which enables us to effect inoculation at a distance
and with ease and certainty. The projectile consists of
a hollow needle with two sheet metal flanges surrounding
it acting like a piston in the cylinder of the gun. The
inoculating liquid is sucked into the needle by its capillarity.
On inserting a metal sphere filled with liquefied
carbon dioxid into this cylinder and pressing this trigger,
a needle penetrates the capsule, liberates the carbon
dioxid, which instantly is converted into gas and drives
the projectile from the gun. The needle has sufficient
force to penetrate the skin until the first of the flanges is
reached. This instantly stops it and the shock forces the
liquid into the wound. The outside of the needle should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>first be coated with an antiseptic to prevent the entrance
of skin bacteria.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This contribution was greeted with great applause and
the gun was seized by a female with a black eye which
she declared had been due to the hoof of a mule—fortunately
unshod. After the confusion had partly subsided
the chairman rapped for order and Zahn proceeded
to read his second paper:</p>

<p class='c015'>“You are of course aware,” he began, “that during the
world war the supply of glycerin became insufficient and
that it was discovered that the addition of some sodium
sulfite to a sugar solution which was seeded with the
yeast plant altered the direction of the fermentation and
caused the formation of large amounts of glycerin—sometimes
as much as 30 per cent of the product. No
careful study of the effect of this addition upon the yeast
plant itself seems to have been made. I have now taken
up this study and have reached some startling conclusions.
Such organisms so produced seem to have lost
many of their original characteristics. Ordinary <i>saccharomyces
cerevisae</i>, for example, grown under these
abnormal conditions will no longer produce normal yeast
fermentation. The progeny of the original cells break,
and we have the same sort of variation that is ordinarily
obtained in raising plants from seed. By varying the
nature of the disturbing substance; that is by replacing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the sodium sulfite by other reagents, I have succeeded in
producing still other modifications which have interesting
properties economically important.</p>

<p class='c015'>“On this slide, which we will now project by the lantern,
we have a photograph of an organism capable of
turning waste molasses into ethyl chloride which is much
used as a local anaesthetic and may be used instead of
ether. It is necessary to add sufficient salt to the solution
to supply the chlorin and the sodium remains behind as
sodium carbonate supplying that necessary product of the
chemical industry at a price defying competition.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here we have the photograph of another modified
organism capable of absorbing carbon dioxid from mixed
gases containing it and building up starch in sunlight
much after the manner of chlorophyl in the plant. The
synthetic starch so produced differs in no particular from
that found in plants and is obtained in large amount
very cheaply from the waste gases given off by our
stoves and furnaces. The supply of such material is very
large and the starchy food that in this way may become
available destroys at once all possibility of future famine
and all necessity of raising wheat, oats, barley, potatoes
or other starchy foods. I hope before long to be able to
announce the discovery of other forms able to produce
albumen and other proteids directly from the atmospheric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>nitrogen, so as to solve for all time the possibility of
future starvation.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This paper was greeted by cheering and immense enthusiasm.
The chairman in proposing a vote of thanks
said that the society had now amply justified the hopes
of its founders and that this would long be marked as a
red letter day in its history.</p>

<p class='c015'>I walked home with Zahn tired with so many wonders.
The next morning I overslept and was late for my train
so that there was no opportunity for any further conversation.
I have not seen my host since that time until
last week. I then made a singular and most distressing
discovery.</p>

<p class='c015'>I had noticed that most of my shirts were frayed at the
wristbands. I needed some new shirts and proceeded to
select them. Judge my surprise when I discovered that
my old friend Zahn was waiting on me! I of course
accosted him by name, only to be met by a blank stare
<a id='tn065'></a>and a firm denial of acquaintance. He assured me that his
name was Smith and that he knew no one by the name of
Zahn. I asked for the proprietor of the store and told
him my story only to be greeted by an incredulous stare.
The proprietor assured me that Smith came to the store
under that name with fine recommendations from previous
employers, and that they had no doubt whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>that he was as represented. I can only suppose that
Zahn had lost his mind through overstudy and with it
his memory. I have noticed that neither I myself nor
either of the other participants in that famous lunch,
now five years ago, appears a day older, and I am dreading
the exhaustion of my bottle and the slow onset of old
age.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
  <h2 id='ch_8' class='c010'>Just Samuel Jones</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>Samuel Jones was an energetic as well as a very careful
young man. He had inherited a small sum of money
from his father. It was his purpose to use so much of
this as was necessary in completing his education; the remainder
was to be carefully invested as a nest egg for
the reserve he intended to create which he spoke and
thought of as The Dam. The idea back of this name
was that if the Dam were big enough and were full it
would keep the mill going for some time should the
springs run dry.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam was careful in other ways also. He laid careful
plans each morning so that no time need be wasted.
If the day was cool he put on a heavy suit; if cloudy he
wore rubbers and carried an umbrella. If the temperature
rose suddenly after such a beginning and the sun
shone brightly, he had at least done his part and this consoled
him for the suffering he must endure. This disposition
subjected Sam to the ridicule of his unmarried
sister, Tilly, who acted as his housekeeper. Tilly was of
a very different build. No one ventured to call Tilly
careful—she was conspicuously careless. She had a
pretty foot and loved to buy new shoes, but she often
dressed in a hurry, and her shoes, having been discarded
in a hurry, were not readily matched. In consequence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>she sometimes appeared at breakfast with a shoe upon
the right foot and a slipper on the left. This impropriety
filled Sam with anguish. Perhaps this difference
in disposition was one of the reasons for their affection,
for they were very fond of each other and they led a
very happy life.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam had a poor opinion of college men. Part of this
low rating was no doubt prejudice and part was due to
the fact that he was not a college man himself. He saw
very clearly, however, that many college men acquire
only a fine polish. The process fails to get enough paint
on the rough wood of the foundation to hide the coarse
grain which shows through in all its crudity. He had
also taken note of his own rather brusque manner, and
laid it, correctly, to the lack of those opportunities which
come to the college man unsought. Anxious to repair
this defect he became precise and a trifle stilted. This
Tilly was not slow to notice and criticize. Tilly loved
college boys and their ways. She listened with attention
to their songs and was up on all their pranks. Their
escapades amused her and she forgave their faults. She
knew them well for they lived in a college town.</p>

<p class='c015'>Back of all Sam’s spur to action was a love of chemistry.
He became enamoured of it in High School where
Steele’s Fourteen Weeks was the text-book. Beginning
by pouring vinegar on baking soda in his mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>kitchen, he had managed to study carefully a good many
chemical substances so that his knowledge was much
broader and deeper than that obtained by most college
students. As the lumberman notices all the straight
trees large enough for sawing so Sam tagged all objects
with formulae. Water was H<sub>2</sub>O; vinegar C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>;
Cream of tartar (CHOH COOH, CHOH COOK); and
sugar C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>. After the death of their mother Sam
had fitted up a laboratory in the attic and hung out the
shingle of an analytical chemist. The income obtained
in this way being too small he conceived the idea of adding
to it by the concoction of various specialties, and
Jones’ Talcum Powder, Jones’ Velvet Cream and Jones’
Tooth Paste made their appearance on the shelves of
neighboring druggists and were spoken of in terms of
praise by those who had used them. These had been
supplemented by various perfumes which found favor
with the weaker sex and became the foundations of a
business which was steadily increasing. Into this scene
of happiness and peaceful prosperity Fate dropped several
bombs.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bomb the First</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>Sam and Tilly loved the movies. They formed a background
of romance to their prosaic lives. They read,
eagerly, all they could find in print about the stars of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>moviedom and were well acquainted with the features of
the prominent actors. Twice a week they attended,
rain or shine. As this involved long walks in bad weather
they had, with the dawn of prosperity, invested in a Ford.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was a windy night in October. There was a threat
of rain in the air as the sullen clouds drifted past over
the moon. As they returned to the car, which had been
left in a side street, a tiny muffled wail greeted them:
“Gracious! it’s a cat,” said Tilly. “Good Lord! it’s a
baby!” It was wrapped in an old, frayed, woolen
blanket. They took it home—what else could they do?—and
Tilly unwrapped it in her warm room. It was clean
and warm and dry, and its clothing, though of the
plainest material and somewhat worn, was also clean.
Tilly declared it was a darling. She sent Sam for a
bottle and some of the best milk, fed the child and
covered her warmly in a large arm chair which was
pushed against the bed so that she might hear the little
one move in the night. Tilly declared the little girl had
aristocratic features. She fell violently in love with her
and declared she would not give her up. Sam smiled and
agreed. He seldom opposed Tilly, though he felt somewhat
doubtful of the propriety of keeping the baby. The
little one grew apace. She soon became the central sun
of the household about which Sam and Tilly revolved—two
obedient satellites.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The household duties soon became too great for Tilly,
and Elizabeth Tillicum was sent for. Elizabeth was a
New Jersey product, redolent of the hills that border the
Delaware. Her hair was sandy—the color of New Jersey
sand. Her eyes were blue—the color of the blue water
of the Atlantic which rolls over the New Jersey sand
beaches, though this water is often green; and her
freckles were—just plain brown freckles. I am not saying
Elizabeth was beautiful—she was not. She agreed
with everyone; she was quite unable to contradict; indeed
her acquiescence was almost slavish. In size she was
opulent. It seemed doubtful when she sat down whether
some portion of her anatomy might not spill over on the
floor but this never actually happened. With all her
disposition to conciliate she persisted in moving slowly,
and all the alleged work that she performed was performed
at a uniform slow speed. Some critics averred
that she did not work—she lolloped. They said that when
she did do work it was so poorly done that it must first
be undone and then done over again. However this may
be, Elizabeth steadfastly, slowly and pleasantly pushed
her way through the world. But she was not a bomb,
she was not even a torpedo.</p>

<p class='c015'>Very few people can be reformed by preaching at them,
object lessons are more effective. Her own carelessness
was well known to Tilly and made her secretly admire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Sam’s precision and half despise Elizabeth’s sloppy work.
The coming of the baby brought a change. Tilly read up
on the care of babies in a volume entitled “The Feeding
and Care of Children.” This learned work explained
the overwhelming importance of cleanliness. It detailed
the various minute bugs which lurk in the air, water
and soil ready to seize and carry off the unsuspecting
child. From a heedless maiden, Tilly was rapidly transformed
into the veriest martinet, watching for the least
speck of impurity to pounce upon and destroy it. Everything
the baby ate was sterilized, and the bottles, spoons
and plates scalded assiduously. Toward this campaign
of cleanliness the baby herself manifested a cynical indifference.
She threw the bottle on the floor. She drew
her spoon through her hair, and after crawling through
all the dirt attainable, rubbed her grimy hands over her
half-cleared plate and then thrust the chubby paws down
her throat. Such behaviour was <i>anathema maranatha</i>
and filled Tilly with despair.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam was at first far from being charmed by the dirt
and disorder which the child insisted upon, but she soon
vanquished him. Her velvet skin, lovely color and wide
open smile would have melted a stone, and Sam soon
became her slave. In return she manifested an ardent
preference for his society; crowed when he came home,
howled when he left, insisted on sitting in his lap, thrust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>her fingers into his eyes, nose and ears, pulled his hair
and showed not the slightest regard for his privacy or
the ordinary courtesies of life. Sam was reformed in
spite of himself. For the sake of peace he put up with
rumpled hair, moist and slimy kisses and greasy fingerprints
on his coat. Such is the mollifying discipline
babies hand around in humanizing their elders.</p>

<p class='c015'>The naming of the baby had been a dreadful ordeal,
and nearly ended in a rupture between Sam and Tilly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We do not know her name,” said Sam, “so we had
better give her one which is merely descriptive; then
when her real name is divulged there will be less temptation
to ignore it. I propose to call her Monday October
Jones until we discover her real name. This is descriptive
of the day of the week and the month she came to
us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She shall have no such barbarous name,” said Tilly.
“You may as well call her Man Friday at once. I will
not have any such name. She is going to have a pretty
name. Monday October Jones: the idea! I shall call
her Arma:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Arma virumque cano</div>
      <div class='line'>Trojae qui primus ab oris</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Don’t you remember that pretty verse Jimmy Case
sings?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Tilly’s words had an air of finality. She had been a
bit uncertain herself until Sam put in an oar. There
was another rhyme which sang through her consciousness
making her undecided. It was:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gaudeamus igitur</div>
      <div class='line'>Juvenes dum sumus</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>that she had heard the college boys sing. But on the
whole she inclined toward Arma, for Gaudeamus did not
sound like a female. So the baby was named Arma
Virumque Jones.</p>

<p class='c015'>Arma was a romantic little soul. She thirsted for the
unusual and wonderful. As she grew to girlhood she
invested those dear to her with imaginary virtues. Tilly
was a lovely and stately lady and Sam the personification
of all that was noble and good. She was a beautiful
girl, with curly brown hair and a clean mind. With her
twelfth birthday began her affairs of the heart. Her
first flame was a beautiful Italian boy who dwelt in an
old house in the alley. This flame was quenched when
she encountered him after he had consumed a larger
ration of garlic than was usual. The next conflagration
was started by the grocer’s boy, but this was quenched
when she overheard him swear. This was followed by
a passion for a young and rather dull divine who never
dreamed of his conquest, so that it died of inanition.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bomb the Second</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The three were sitting in the living room one evening
in June. Sam and Tilly were reading and Arma was
getting out her lessons, when a resounding knock on the
door was heard, and a great big, strong, jolly man burst
in, shook hands with Sam and noisily proclaimed how
glad he was to see “this darn old fraud” once more.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam’s face lighted with pleasure as he welcomed him
and introduced him as “Billy Gesundheit, my old friend
and comrade in Pittsburgh.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My word, what a name!” thought Tilly, “But what a
fine looking man. He seems too good to be true.” This
was during her trip upstairs to inspect the guest room
where he was to spend the night.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam had lived two years in the smokehouse city as
chemist to a young struggling steel plant. Before he
left this puny infant industry had begun putting on the
seven league boots of manhood. At this time Gesundheit
was a hearty young workman to whom Sam took a
fancy. This was vigorously reciprocated; Sam was
carried off to Billy’s home and introduced to his widowed
mother who was a wonderful housekeeper. She became
interested in Sam at once—for was he not a friend of
her Billy?—sewed on his buttons, darned his socks, and
wound up by taking complete possession. Sam soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>moved into their spare room and, as the homely phrase
has it, “she ate him and slept him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Billy informed them that he had risen in rank considerably
since Sam’s departure and was now acting as
manager of the works. He had come to New York on
business and must soon leave for home; he expected to
make frequent visits, however, and here he looked at
Tilly, and he would not fail to visit them as often as possible.
He also informed them that to-morrow was a
holiday for them; he was to take entire charge, manage
all details and pay all expenses; all they need do was to
enjoy themselves as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c015'>After breakfast next morning Billy produced a map of
the city for each member of the party. “A taxicab is
coming at eight,” he began, “to take us to the place where
our excursion starts. I’m going to walk part of the way<a id='tn076'></a>;
the rest of you may do so or ride, just as you please.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where are we going?” said Tilly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We are going to circumnavigate the city,” said Billy.
“I doubt whether you know your own town. Most people
do not. If we first go around it, and then go through all
the streets and alleys you will know it on the outside at
least. After we get through we will quiz one another
on the names of the streets and alleys and their location.
It is good fun and has a use beside.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>For about a mile the city line ran along the middle of a
highway. It was not a well paved highway. There were
stones, tin cans and piles of rubbish to be dodged. Then
the line led through an orchard. Here Billy got out, inviting
the others to go with him, but only Tilly accepted
the invitation. The others followed the road, agreeing
to wait for the pedestrians at a point further along, while
the foot passengers gracefully climbed the fence. They
had not gone more than a few hundred feet among the
trees, which were old and decayed, before they caught
sight of a house ahead. Sitting on the back porch in a
hickory rocking chair was an ancient lady, clad in calico,
rocking gently to and fro while knitting a pair of socks.
As the travelers drew near, she looked up and said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m knitting these socks for my son. He don’t like
wool next his skin, so I use cotton, but I have an awful
time getting the right kind of thread. If the thread is
too coarse, he says they look like gunny bags and if it
is too fine the socks are not warm enough. He is very
pertickler, my son is. Maybe you know him; his name is
Winterbottom; first name Jeremiah, after his father.
He’s well known in Wilmington. Don’t you know him?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” said Billy, sitting down on the edge of the porch
and making room for Tilly beside him, “I don’t know him
but I hear he is a very fine man. I hope you will tell us
more about him. What is his business?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“Making flat irons. What’s yours?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I make iron and steel.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t see then why you don’t know him. You got
a nice lookin wife.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank you, I think so too,” said Billy, while Tilly
blushed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why did you let her think we were married?” said
Tilly, after they had left the old lady behind.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well I kinda wish we were, and I hoped she only had
the news a little ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You are certainly a fast worker.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure, I no sooner saw you than I picked you. I can
always make up my mind quickly, and I’m after you
from now on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This made Tilly laugh, but she did not seem displeased.</p>

<p class='c015'>They picnicked in a grove near the edge of town and
then finished the circuit. Then they navigated all the
streets and alleys and returned home to quiz one another
all that evening. They were all surprised to find how
much they had learned about the city.</p>

<p class='c015'>Billy’s visits followed one another in quick succession.
He knew his own mind, as he had said, and Tilly’s inclined
to him more and more. When Sam awoke to the
state of affairs he knew the second bomb had fallen and
might burst at any minute.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bomb the Third</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Arma’s first loves were merely fancies. Having no
substantial foundation they died as soon as born. Sam
and Tilly had made no secret of her origin and she was
spared a shock when she learned it of those pests of
society whom, like the poor and Congress, we have
always with us. She was a great reader and devoured
all the books she could obtain. Among these was Charlotte
Bronte’s story of “The Professor.” With the reading
of this story a new point of view dawned upon her.
She had before this looked upon Sam as immeasurably
older and belonging to a disappearing age. But it appeared
that a difference of ages was not so important as
she had imagined, indeed might be an advantage from
many points of view. Her previous flames had been
boys, except for the divine, and he was a man of no perception—not
worth considering. Besides, Sam had
money—almost always a consideration with girls, who
are nearly always full of worldly wisdom. Sam had become
a possibility. As she studied him further he became
a probability. She grew shy and a trifle coquettish.
But Sam for a long time took no notice. He was absorbed
in other matters.</p>

<p class='c015'>Arma was, of course, very much interested in Tilly’s
love affair as it developed. She viewed it with much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>favor. The same worldly wisdom which told her that
Sam was desirable from a matrimonial point of view,
told her also that if Tilly should go to Pittsburgh Sam
must more fully depend upon her. She became interested
in cooking and studied all Sam’s needs. Tilly was studying
Billy at the same time. Arma secretly began to resent
any interference with Sam—he was her property. She
pampered him like a born mother—which she was.</p>

<p class='c015'>Gradually but unconsciously Arma revealed her new
set of ideas to Tilly who was not lacking in perception;
but Tilly made no sign—she was relieved. For Sam’s
welfare was dear to her, and here were other hands to
take up the tasks she must lay down. She became Arma’s
co-conspirator, gradually resigning to her the primacy
in Sam’s affairs which she had hitherto kept as her own.</p>

<p class='c015'>As Arma became absorbed in Sam, she began to manifest
an interest in his work and asked many questions.
It was pleasant to teach a pupil so bright, so much interested
and so beautiful—for Sam could not help but
notice her beauty. There were others who saw it also.
The young men began to call and she was not annoyed at
first; but few of them interested her very long. They
knew so little. One day she betrayed herself. One of
these boys had bored her for an hour before he departed
and she met Sam in the passage.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, has he gone?” said Sam.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Yes, he has,” she replied, “and I am so glad, I like
you much better.” And these words were accompanied
by a look which would have awakened and galvanized
an anchorite, and then she blushed a rosy red and fled.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are really two bombs in this chapter. Arma’s
bomb was a copy of “The Professor,” Sam’s bomb was
the look Arma gave him when she blushed.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bomb the Fourth and Last</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>It came the next morning while Arma was concocting
a tapioca pudding—one of Sam’s favorites. There was
a ring at the front door and a well-dressed lady entered
and asked: “Does Samuel Jones live here?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” said Arma.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you the little girl they found in their auto?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” said Arma, wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then I am your mother.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why did you give me away?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your father deserted me and I was penniless. I have
been poor ever since until quite recently, too poor to
claim you. An uncle in California died last month and
left me his money. I have been out settling his estate
and I am just back. I want you to go with me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” said Arma, “I cannot go with you but I can see
you very often, and I am so glad I have a mother to love.”
Then they fell into each others arms in tears.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>When Arma told her story at lunch the others gasped.
She continued: “I think I must go to her.” Then Sam
gasped: “My God! I’ll be all alone. Get her to come
here, Arma, I can’t bear to have you go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Now wasn’t Arma a sly puss? And she did not go,
Sam went to her. He told her how much he loved her.
She listened sagely and said: “yes, she liked him pretty
well. She thought she might like to stay with him.” And
she did. And after awhile Sam discovered that she had
been madly in love with him all the time—but he did not
discover this for a long time, she was a woman and did
not tell all she knew for awhile. She grew more fond
of Sam every day and now she tells him everything—almost.</p>

  <h2 id='ch_9' class='c010'>Fat and Lean</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>This story was told by lame Lewellyn Sangster to his
aunt Margaret, uncle Fred, cousin Anita and Sam the
hired man.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nan Heberlein and Lula Manting were fast friends.
They were fond of meeting at each others’ homes and
pretending to sew; sometimes they did sew; sometimes
they promptly adjourned and went to the movies; sometimes
they called in their lady friends who were of the
same order of busy, and played 500, or bridge, or some
other game; but always they talked; and laughed; and
ate. They were not singular people: they fitly represented
the average American lady who does most of her
own work, feeds and dresses her children and sends them
to school, and in the afternoon finds an hour or more to
relax.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nan was tall and slim, Lula was getting plump—at
least so her friends called it; her unfriends said she was
pursey. But no one was so conscious of her too great
rotundity as Lula herself. It was constantly in the back
of her mind and frequently in a front pew. She liked to
discuss it with her friends and her husband—complainingly,
anxiously, plaintively, contemplatively, suggestively
and in various other ways. Jake listened and
grunted; sometimes he forgot to listen and grunt while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>his mind was dwelling on the quantity of sugar, or
molasses, or something else needed in the store. She
occasionally noted this lack of attention on Jake’s part
but did not really resent it, for, she thought; if he
doesn’t pay much attention to it he probably still likes
me all right. But if he should notice much, or if it should
increase, I must certainly do something. But this something,
what should it be? What method must be adopted?
She consulted the doctor on his next visit. That much
harassed and suffering servant of humanity suggested
more exercise and careful avoidance of fat and sugar in
the diet. He also suggested that it would be well to eat
very sparingly and always leave the table hungry. This
gave her something to do, and she straightway began a
course of sprouts with herself. It was a sore trial to
eat too little, but she did it. Was it not worth something
to retain Jake’s admiration and desolation to lose it?</p>

<p class='c015'>This whole matter was duly discussed and thoroughly
considered, forwards, backwards and sideways, when she
and Nan next met. After which Nan trotted out <i>her</i>
trouble. It was necessary, she said, that she should
gain weight. Tom had commented on her slimness, compared
her to a rail and several other articles more noted
for length than breadth. Nan only weighed 115. She
should <a id='tn084'></a>weigh at least 140. How could she increase her
weight? Lula had been reading up about such matters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>in a book recommended by Dr. Dash, and she would see
what he said and report.</p>

<p class='c015'>This was done and Nan was recommended to eat
plenty of raw eggs every day. A dozen a day would
not be too many. If she could not afford so many eat
as many as she thought she could afford; and drink lots
of milk. If this would not make her fat nothing would.
It was necessary, too, to take lots of exercise. The
doctors say that exercise is necessary to health, and
whether you are to get thin or fat exercise is of first importance.</p>

<p class='c015'>After two weeks of self denial and exercise to excess,
as she thought, Lula, who had weighed 160, found her
net reduced to 155. This seemed to her hard lines. The
game was not worth the candle. But she persevered and
at the end of two weeks more had fallen to 150. This
was encouraging, but she began to fear she would not
be able to hold out forever. She was so desperately
hungry! Her dreams began to be haunted by luscious
feasts. She woke up in the night, ravenous. She told
Jake that if she were not desperately fond of him she
would bite him. At this, Jake only grunted. The worst
deprivation was candy. She was extravagantly fond of
it, but the doctor sternly forbade it. Candy, fat and
sugar, as well as starchy foods were to be eschewed;
even potatoes were forbidden.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Nan, on the contrary, had eaten raw eggs and milk
until she gagged every time she undertook to eat a raw
egg in milk. Lula suggested using a little brandy to give
a flavor, but this soon palled. She did manage to reach
118 but halted there. Lula halted, too, on the downward
path, at 150. No amount of fasting or exercise seemed
to avail. About this time she discovered that her skin
was getting wrinkled and that, worst of all, wrinkles
were forming on her face. After much consultation it
was decided that a visit to a beauty doctor might possibly
remedy this. Instead of one visit several were required.
All this time her appetite was growing mightier and
mightier. Finally she fell. They had been shopping together.
She had seen candy displayed until she was
reckless. In this mood, after leaving Nan, she hurried
into a candy shop with the air of a criminal, bought and
ate half a pound. Nothing serious happened immediately,
so in a few days she bought and ate again—clandestinely.
Made reckless by lack of immediate results
she resumed her old habits and presently found
her weight increasing rapidly—more rapidly than it had
gone down.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nan had become discouraged. She felt well—better
than she had felt for a long time. She had, in fact, before
this been eating too little. Too many meals had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>passed with nothing eaten but tea and toast—now she
was really nourished for the first time in years.</p>

<p class='c015'>About this time she heard some one remark that yeast
was a very fattening food, and that she herself had put
on twenty pounds by eating a cake daily for three months.
So Nan bought a cake and ate it with many qualms. It
was certainly not very agreeable to the taste. She persevered,
however, and after two weeks discovered that
she was indeed gaining. In fact she began to get fat.
Slowly but steadily she put on weight until she became
alarmed. She was obliged to buy an entire new outfit
and although she stopped the yeast cakes she still swelled.
Now in despair she began, like Lula, to diet.</p>

<p class='c015'>But imagine if you can all the discussions, the visits
to and fro, the consultations without end to which these
fluctuations led. In mercy I have not recounted them—but
they took place.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lula did her own washing, rolled on the floor every
morning, practised calisthenics. Wonderful to relate,
she began to lose flesh steadily; her skin wrinkled and
her color faded. She became alarmed and consulted the
doctor who failed to find anything wrong. Now Lula
is desperately trying to lay on flesh while Nan is just as
determinedly reducing.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“I never realized before,” said Lewellyn, “what an
awful thing it must be to be a woman.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is indeed piteous,” said Sam. “The poor things
have to wear skirts; they are not allowed to put their
feet on the table or spit tobacco juice on the stove. But
then they are freely allowed to do the washing and such
light work as taking care of ten or twelve children.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You must remember the disabilities she suffers,” said
Fred. “She is not allowed to go to war, nor is she expected
to haul out manure in the hot weather. When the
time comes for putting in wheat I know of nothing more
enjoyable than hauling out manure and spreading it on
the field. The smell is appetizing, and like most perfume,
it clings. The flies are active and make the horses playful.
I seldom enjoy life so much as then; and it worries
me that the dear ladies are not privileged to participate.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sam is right,” said Anita, “The women are privileged
to bring up the children. They bear the brunt of their
childish impatience, recklessness and disobedience. They
stay up with them nights when they are sick and they
are expected to be patient and long suffering with husbands
and children when they can scarcely drag one foot
after the other. I <i>have</i> known of cases,” she continued,
“where the women hauled coal out of the cellars habitually,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and cases are known where women plow, haul
manure, clean out dirty stables and help in the field. I
don’t really think the women need complain that their
work is lacking either in quality, quantity or variety.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch_10' class='c010'>Woozy</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>Woozy opened his eyes for the first time and looked
up. There was a little boy, and in his hand was a
saucer in which was some white stuff. The boy smiled at
him. Woozy was interested in the white stuff; it looked
good. He licked some with his tongue. It tasted good
but it was very cold. Woozy licked it again but pretty
soon his tongue got so cold he would have to stop licking
for awhile. But he went on licking and after awhile
it was all gone and the dish was licked clean. Then he
looked up at the boy and said: “Woof!” But it was
a very small woof, for Woozy was a very small, round,
roly poly puppy. He said woof, three or four times but
the boy only smiled for he had no more of the white
stuff. He would have given more to Woozy if he had
had it but he could not give more if he did not have it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Pretty soon the door opened and a monstrous big dog
came in. She went over and tried to lick the boy’s face.
Then she laid down beside him. Then the boy took a ball
of cord and rolled it into a corner and Woozy trotted
after it. He grabbed it and worried it, and growled—frightfully.
Pretty soon his mother went over to him,
took him by the back of the neck and carried him over
to the boy and laid him down, as much as to say:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think he is naughty, and you had better make him
behave.” But the boy just smiled and stroked the dogs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>with his hand. First he would stroke the mother and
then he would stroke Woozy. The mother would lick
his hand but Woozy pinched it with his sharp little teeth.</p>

<p class='c015'>Woozy and the boy grew up together. They both got
bigger every day until the boy was nearly as big as his
father and Woozy nearly as big as his mother. Woozy
thought the boy was perfect. He followed him everywhere.
If you saw the boy anywhere you might know
that Woozy was around, and if you saw Woozy you
might know that the boy was not far off.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sometimes they took long walks together in the woods.
Woozy would run off among the trees but pretty soon he
would come back to the boy and look up in his face and
say: “woof,” which meant why don’t you come along and
have some fun? Once robbers tried to steal the boy, but
Woozy growled and showed his teeth until the robbers
ran away.</p>

<p class='c015'>One day the boy was crossing a pasture field. There
was a cross bull there lying down behind some bushes.
When he saw the boy he began pawing the dirt and then
he ran after him. Woozy grabbed the bull’s tail and held
on till the bull turned around. Then he fell off and
rolled over and over. The bull ran after him and stuck
one horn through his poor body. The boy had climbed
over the fence and he screamed and cried with all his
might. Then the bull threw up his head and poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Woozy’s dead body flew over the fence. Oh, how mad
the boy was and how he cried! His mamma said,
“Never mind dear, Woozy was willing to give his life for
you.” But the boy was lonely, and he cried as hard as
he could cry when they buried Woozy in the garden.</p>

  <h2 id='ch_11' class='c010'>The Hermit</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>In a cave on the south side of the mountain there
once lived a hermit. He was only middle aged but his
hair was white. He was kind of manner and speech but
he often sighed as one bereft of hope. He worked for
the farmers round about, who paid him with potatoes or
other produce or sometimes with money when they could
spare it. He lived a lonely life on the mountainside with
no one to share it. Here he snared rabbits and caught
skunks and foxes and sold their skins. In a space before
the cave he built a rough cabin which concealed the
entrance. To one side of this he built a shack to house
his chickens and on the other side he planted apples,
pears and peaches. Grapes he shunned as open to misconstruction.
He gathered firewood in the forest and no
one molested him. The water for drinking and cooking
came from a spring on the mountainside not far from his
door.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was kind to the children and often gave them
candy. The path to and from the schoolhouse led past
his door and he often saw the school teacher passing.
She was a lady who had begun to teach several years
before this story opens. She had been very beautiful as
a girl but now some of her fresh complexion had gone
where the good complexions go, and she was using a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>powder puff instead. Her nose was a little sharper and
she was rather more positive in some of her ideas than
she had been as a young girl. The children always
spoke to the hermit and in this way she got to know him.</p>

<p class='c015'>At Christmas time she had a two-weeks vacation.
There was a heavy fall of snow which drifted, so that
all the roads were closed. She said to her mother:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wonder how my poor hermit is getting along in
this snow, all alone on the mountainside.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is too <a id='tn094'></a>bad,” said her mother, who did and said
pretty much as Anna-Bell wished her.</p>

<p class='c015'>When school opened again she stopped at his house to
enquire.</p>

<p class='c015'>The hermit said he was getting along pretty well, thank
you, but she looked around the room with distaste. There
was much dirt in the corners, the windows needed cleaning
and dirty dishes were standing on the table.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t you ever go to town?” said she.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” he replied, “I am going this afternoon and shall
not get home until after dark.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She made no reply but a light came into her eyes.
After school she hurried to the cottage, pinned a towel
around her and began to sweep and scrub. Then she
closed the door carefully and went home. When he came
home it seemed more cheerful but he noticed nothing
more. The next morning he only said: “Good Morning,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>though she seemed to expect something more. That
afternoon on her way home she asked him for a drink of
water.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then she said to him: “Where are you from?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My home was in New York,” said he.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What did you do?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I was in the commission business,” he replied, “but
I grew ashamed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You deserve a reward,” said she, “choose one!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I need a cook,” said he, “come and cook for me as
soon as you can learn.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch_12' class='c010'>Sandy’s Story</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>I used to live in New Jersey when I was young, in a
place called Lopatcong Mills. I was workin in the mills.
There was two other fellers workin there with me and we
was about the same age, size and build, as you might say.</p>

<p class='c015'>One of the fellers was Sam Harkness and the other
Enos Kerber. Enos was all for gittin married. He
was e’enamost crazy about gals, and I guess he pestered
’em some. Anyhow he didn’t seem to get along very
fast gittin married.</p>

<p class='c015'>I aint very keen about gals myself, and I wasn’t then;
but, as I said, Enos liked to be with ’em. He spent most
all his wages buyin ice cream fer ’em. He said he kinda
liked to see ’em lickin it up like nice little pussy cats.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” I says, “I guess you would like to be a mouse,”
says I, “and listen to what they says.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” says he, “but they use me like the cat would
a mouse.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Well, he was always talkin about the gals and about
gittin married ’till I got e’enamost worn out. So one
day I says: “Enos,” says I, “why don’t you advertise?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Advertise fer what?” says he.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why, fer a wife,” says I.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” says he, “where can I do it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam Harkness and me put our heads together, as you
might say, and we wrote an “ad” like this:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Advertiser wants to marry <a id='tn097a'></a>nice-looking girl about 20.
Address with photo<a id='tn097b'></a>, Box 28, Phillipsburg, N. J.”</p>

<p class='c015'>We sent this with $5.00 to a paper in Chicago that we
had seen, and pretty soon Enos began to git letters and
photos. The photos was all good lookin; and to some
of the best lookers Enos sent hisn. Now, hisn was what
you might call a side face, kinda sickly smilin, as if the
man that took it had said: “Now look smilin!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Enos wasn’t a bad looker, himself, nor he wasn’t no
beauty neither.</p>

<p class='c015'>One day I took the bosses wife to the train; and I
was standin on the platform, when a middle aged female
comes up to me and flung her arms around me.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hello! Sandy,” says she, “here I am. Aint ye glad?
Why,” she says, “you’re better lookin than yer picture.
I just took <i>such</i> a fancy to it that I got right on the train
and come right on, and here I am.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who are you lookin fer?” says I, gittin flustered, “I
don’t know nothing about this. What do you mean, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Young man,” says she, “is this you? and is this your
handwritin?” so sayin, she pulls out a picture of me and
a letter which I had written fer Enos in lead pencil; but
his name was rubbed out and mine signed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, that’s my picture,” says I, “but that letter’s a
forgery, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Well, she bust out a cryin and a crowd begun to form,
so I put her in the wagon and took her to the mill fer
dinner. Then I brought her back and put her on the
train, her crying most of the time. I paid her fare both
ways and she said I was real kind and must come to see
her, but I aint been yet.</p>

  <h2 id='ch_13' class='c010'>The Hoboes</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>After the close of the Civil War, from 1865 to a
much later date, a great many men had been soldiers and
were discharged, had grown fond of a wandering life
and were unable to resist its charms. It was about this
time that the army of tramps gained so many recruits
as to become a great national nuisance. Many of these
men were still clad, in whole or in part, in army blue
uniforms; and some of the army overcoats survived
several winters. There were many of these hoboes on
the road, moving from place to place, sometimes afoot,
sometimes beating their way on the railroads, where they
finally became a menace to the trainmen and to the communities
along the right of way.</p>

<p class='c015'>Most of the subsistence of these tramps was lifted
from the charitable by the process known as “slamming
gates.” Not a few of the tramps were very soft spoken
when men or cross dogs were about but became bold and
saucy when the women folks were alone. The food
gained by begging was supplemented by petty thefts of
chickens, eggs, green corn and other produce and the
snaring of rabbits and other small game.</p>

<p class='c015'>Just above Milford, New Jersey, the Delaware River
breaks through a ridge of New Red Sandstone, forming
a cliff of red rock, the color of which is due to peroxid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of iron, facing the south. Along these cliffs there are
many ledges; and in the winter, as the sun beats against
these ledges, it heats the rocks and creates an atmosphere
several degrees warmer than that of the surrounding
country.</p>

<p class='c015'>On one of these ledges overhanging the railroad, which
follows the New Jersey shore of the river, a band of
hoboes had established their camp. There had been a
heavy fall of snow the night before as two tramps were
released from the county prison at Flemington where
they had been spending a sad week breaking stone.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Better not come this way again,” said the Sheriff as
he released them; “we’ve got your numbers here, and
next time you’ll get a heavy dose.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m going to head for Milford camp,” said Harvard
Jim to Deadwood Ike, his companion, “I am getting tired
of Jersey.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“This here beats cock fightin,” replied Ike. “Every
darn muscle in my body aches to beat the band, and here
we’re turned out in the snow. Lucky we had breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c015'>All day they plodded doggedly along toward Milford,
cold and with wet feet. At noon they had several
“hand outs” which fended off starvation, and that night
they camped in a wood where the bushes sheltered them
and their fire. The next day was warmer and the sun
shone, melting the snow. They reached the camp with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>wet feet, tired and hungry and were greeted with jeers
and laughter. The pot was boiling over a wood fire and
they were soon fed and warmed. The ground was bare
and not too dry as they hunted a place to rest. Finally,
Ike curled down and tried to go to sleep, but was kept
awake by an intolerable prickling sensation in his back.
This grew worse until it became intolerable.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Say boys!” said he, “Something’s the matter with my
back.” So saying, he started to strip off his coat.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wait a minute,” said Harvard Jim, “you have something
hanging to your coat.” So saying, he pulled it off
but immediately began to dance and swear.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s a cactus,” said another tramp. “I forgot to
tell you they’re thick around here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The best part of an hour was spent in picking spines
from their respective hides, and then they once more
went to rest, this time carefully inspecting the premises
to avoid the cactus.</p>

<p class='c015'>Next morning they started for the Milford Bridge resolved
to quit Jersey forever; but at the bridge they were
met by the toll-keeper who declined to allow them to
pass without the customary two cents each. This they
did not have but were forced to beg with poor success—plenty
to eat but no money. Just at this point they were
stopped by the constable who put them under arrest for
begging.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Say, friend,” said Harvard Jim, “if you will find us
a place where we can saw some wood for a quarter we
will pay our way over the bridge and stay away from
Jersey.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” said the constable, “I have some wood
myself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>For two hours they toiled, one with the saw, the other
with the axe, sawing and splitting a huge pile of firewood,
inspected meanwhile by the constable. At the end of
this time they struck work and were offered ten cents
each.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have a heart, brother,” said Ike, “that’s no way to
treat us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Beat it, or I’ll put you in the jug,” said he, “and
none of your lip, either.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They were silent until they reached the middle of the
bridge; then Ike shook his fist at Jersey and swore furiously.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Breakin stone, trampin in snow, sleepin on cactus,
sawin wood, an cheatin constables. Damn such a State!”</p>

  <h2 id='ch_14' class='c010'>Jumping Steel</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose you know<a id='tn103'></a>,” said Sam “that there are a great
many kinds of steel in the market nowadays, such as high
carbon steel, low carbon steel, manganese steel, tungsten
steel, nickel steel....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” said Lewellyn, “and Wildcat oil steal and Wall
Street steals....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now, Lewellyn,” said aunt Margaret, “this is Sam’s
story, not yours.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” said Lewellyn, “I guess I can stand it if
you can.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There are a great many ways of treating steel, too,”
continued Sam, “for giving it desired properties, some of
which have been very successful.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I knew a fellow in the Bethlehem Steel Company
several years ago who was a nut on steel treating. He
said that by selecting the proper kind of steel, such as
nickel steel or chrome steel or some other sort, it was
possible to get any desired properties if you gave the steel
proper heat treatment. He was my roommate for a
year and he talked about this so much that I got all worn
out—and mad.</p>

<p class='c015'>“First I told him that I wanted a steal that could not
be found out but he paid no attention. Then I asked
whether it would be possible to make a steel for springs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>that could be pushed down two inches and come back
four. I found I had given him something to think about.
He shut up right away and began to think. I could
always tell when he was thinking by the fishy stare that
came into his eye; like the eye of a fresh fish that is ten
days old.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He studied on this for nearly a week and I had a
blessed rest. I began to hope it would keep him quiet
forever; but at the end of the week he said he thought
he could do it. His eyes had lost the fishy stare and a
smile spread over his face and stayed there. I forget
what the steel was to have in it but I remember it was to
contain molybdenum.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He went up to Bethlehem the very next day and I
saw no more of him for a week. When he came back he
said he had been working hard and thought he was on
the track but the darn stuff was brittle. Still he thought
he might be able to overcome that if he had time enough.
I told him he could have all the time that was coming
but he paid no attention. Every time he came back
after that he would sit and stare and the fishy look
would come back: then he would slap his leg and hurry
back to Bethlehem.</p>

<p class='c015'>“About a month after I had put the idea into his head
he came back one day and said he had the kind of steel
I wanted.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“I told him to make me two coiled springs two inches
wide and four inches long, with a steel plate fastened
to either end. One of these plates was to have four
holes in for screws, so it could be fastened to the heel
of a shoe. I said that on second thought he had better
make three springs, so that if one broke we might still
have enough.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, he thought that might be wise, because springs
were apt to break. When he came back next time he
had a dozen springs in a box. They were beautifully
made and were silver plated, too.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then we couldn’t agree at first who should put them
on and see how they worked. He said I had started the
idea, and it would not be fair that he should have the
honor of first trying them. But I said the idea was not
worth much; he had made the right kind of steel and the
way to heat treat it; that was two to my one. I was
really afraid to try the darn things myself, and when
you hear what happened you won’t wonder.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We fastened one spring to each of a pair of his shoes.
He did not put them on but carried them and wore
another pair to the end of Bushkill Street where we
planned to try them out. There isn’t much traffic there,
and we wanted a quiet place for our experiment. He
put on the spring shoes at Green Street and jumped towards
the river. The first jump was two feet, the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>four, the third eight and the fourth sixteen. By the
time he got to the river he was jumping sixty-four feet
at a clip. Then the spring on his left foot broke with a
loud crack and he turned half around and struck the
water horizontally at thirty miles an hour. He went
under and came up a little further on, came around in a
circle and shot out on the sand. He was stunned at first,
but as soon as he felt a little better he asked me to get
his other shoes and take these off, which I did.</p>

<p class='c015'>“After that we walked home and he sat thinking for
quite awhile. After he came out of this trance he said it
seemed easy enough to go, the problem was, how were
we to stop? He thought it would be easy to steer, too,
by holding one foot out a little further than the other.
We could learn to do that easy enough. The best way
to stop, he thought, would be to have a spring on the
end of a stick. By holding this so it would strike the
ground first it would send you back and then you would
stop.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So he got a stick, or rather two sticks—one for each
hand—and put a spring on each. We had our next
jumpin match on the Twelfth Street lot about midnight
of a moonlight night. He jumped two feet and came
back four; jumped eight feet and came back sixteen.
By the time he was up to sixty-four feet he struck the
roof of a house, went through and landed in a bed. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>was lucky he did: he might have been killed if he had
landed anywhere else. It was a slate roof, and he was
pretty badly scratched when he came down in his stocking
feet. He was afraid to keep his shoes on for fear
he might get started again. The man who owned the
house was with him, looking pretty mad.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It cost him quite a little to mend the roof and pacify
the man, but he finally got it fixed up. I told him he
wanted to be more careful; next time he might land in
a bed with some girl or the old woman and that would
cost him more yet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I got so nervous about this time that I moved into
another room. I was afraid if I went on going out with
him the police might manage to stay awake long enough
to pinch us. The last time I saw him he told me they had
made some bed springs out of this steel by mistake and
some of them were sent out and used. He heard of a
man who had a cot in his summer tent. He came in one
afternoon very tired and threw himself on the cot and the
next thing he knew he flew through the top of the tent
fell back and broke through and landed on the floor with
an awful jolt. He told me he was sure that steel would
be a money maker as soon as he learned how to control
it.<a id='tn107'></a>”</p>

  <h2 id='ch_15' class='c010'>All the Way from Melbourne</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>A college teacher learns much about far away places
if he cares to do so. This knowledge is also very intimate
and very accurate. It is the kind of knowledge that
cannot be drawn from books of travel or from encyclopedias.
It is first-hand information given by people who
have lived there. It is obtained from his students. Most
of those he is called upon to teach come, probably, from
within a radius of fifty or a hundred miles. There is always
a sprinkling, however, of boys from far off places.</p>

<p class='c015'>Rochambeau College always has a few such. I can
remember among them several from Japan, from China,
India, South America, and one from Siam. We sometimes
hear from these boys after they have returned to
their homes and once in a great while we are rich enough
to visit them. What a fuss they make when we do and
how glad they seem to be to see us. I have been something
of a traveler in a small way and everywhere I have
gone, and been able to turn aside to visit the boys, I have
met the most cordial welcome. This is one of the rewards
that come to the teacher who has tried to do his
best. Sometimes he comes in contact with people from
distant lands in strange ways; and it is about one of
these strange happenings that I am about to tell.</p>

<p class='c015'>After I had been teaching for several years I married
Sally Lunn, the daughter of a local baker. We had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>two sons and a daughter to bless our union. I noticed as
the years passed that my surplus cash was waning rather
than waxing. This led me to make a careful review of
the situation. My salary was scarcely opulent and was
not mounting with great rapidity. It was evident that if
Providence saw fit to endow us with a continued shower
of childish blessings I must either find more income or
breakfast, lunch and dine on corn mush—and I was not
fond of mush.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among my early investments had been the purchase
of a printing press. The outfit was a small one but it
was complete and such as enabled me to make a beginning
as a printer in a small way. As I practised the art
I became constantly more skilful and could now print a
very fair job. This seemed to furnish an opening and
I went to work. The venture was moderately successful
and led to a decided, though moderate, increase in my
income. Presently I was able to buy a larger press and
more type and to rent a room in the town in which to install
it. Here I employed a competent foreman and
began my commercial career.</p>

<p class='c015'>I had written a text book for my pupils in the meantime
and this I printed and published. Then I started
a journal in which my book was advertised, leading to
orders from abroad and the influx of manuscripts from
my friends. In a few years I had a prosperous business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>on my hands and all my spare time was usefully employed.
It soon became necessary to arrange for agents
for the sale of my publications abroad. This was easily
arranged in London and Tokio but more difficult in other
places. I wrote to Secretary of Commerce Hoover for
the name of an agent in Melbourne and he sent me the
names of about fifty firms, dealers in books in that
place. I immediately aimed at the flock and fired four
letters at random, but brought down no birds. Weeks
and months passed on without a response.</p>

<p class='c015'>I am a late riser by preference and an early one only
under compulsion. I was finishing my breakfast at a
moderate rate one morning when word came that a
gentleman had called and was waiting for me. My
visitor was a middle aged man, plainly dressed in tweed
with a cloth cap. He informed me that he was traveling
for pleasure and had undertaken to go from New York
to San Francisco by auto. He had stopped for the night
at our local hotel and in descending a dark <a id='tn110'></a>stairway had
fallen and broken his arm. He was admitted to the
hospital, permitted the setting of the arm and submitted
to the necessary delay—for it was impossible to drive
with one arm. He found himself doomed to inaction,
for his daily occupation was confined to a visit to the
hospital to have his arm dressed, and time hung heavy
on his hands. In this dilemma he inquired of Dr. Kuhlmann,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>his attendant and one of my old students, whether
there was not some one else in the place with a taste for
science. Dr. Kuhlmann had referred him to me.</p>

<p class='c015'>I told Mr. Humphreys that I was very glad to meet
him and would do my best to help him pass the time
pleasantly during his enforced delay. I found he was
posted on his own country, Australia. He knew something
about its geology and about its politics also. I
announced that we would have an evening together with
our professors of geology and economics in a day or two,
as soon as it could be arranged. In the meantime I asked
him whether he liked to dance? He said he did, and my
wife, who had met him by this time, invited him to
spend that very evening with us—we expected some
young people in to dance and thought it might amuse
him. He came and was much liked by the young folks.
A few evenings later he came to tea with us and spent the
evening with the two professors and their wives. Of
course they pumped him for first-hand information and
obtained it. We spent a delightful and very profitable
evening together.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next morning I proposed to take him over my
publishing house. We met there and made the rounds.
I showed him some of our books and he appeared to be
more than ordinarily interested in them. As he was
leaving he informed me that he was starting for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>West in the morning after. “I don’t see why,” he said,
“I might not sell some of your books myself. I am a
scientific bookseller in Melbourne, and I shall take great
pleasure in selling as many of your books as I can.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch_16' class='c010'>A Defense of the Wealthy</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>Contrary to a generally held opinion, there are some
wealthy people who may be successfully defended. There
are not so many of them, however, that any serious
disturbance need be created. There is, perhaps, some
danger that these may be overlooked in the universal
damnation that is being handed out to the malefactors of
great wealth.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first exception to be noted is that of the inventor.
Quite a few of these men have lightened our tasks to a
very considerable extent. They have in a few cases
amassed a competence by taxing us for their inventions
for seventeen years. After that their work is free for
all, at least in theory. A great many of these men have
had no benefit from their inventions and might well be
pensioned from public funds. In not a few cases the
profits that should have gone to them have been filched
by men who had money to lend. Such cases should be
overhauled and the ill-gotten gains of the banker folks
restored to their proper owners. It would be well also
to give the bankers the spanking they need, thus making
one job of the whole business.</p>

<p class='c015'>When we think that Whitney, who invented the cotton
gin; Steinmetz, the electrical wizard; Pupin, who perfected
the telephone; Edison, Gray, Acheson, Morse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>McCormick and thousands of others, some as well,
others less well known belong to this class, we realize
how greatly we are indebted to them, and how cheaply
we get off by allowing them to profit by their inventions
for seventeen short years.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then there are some school teachers and college professors
who might be excepted and a few ministers.
Some of these fellows married money, and we will not
except these; some of them inherited money, and we
will not except these; a few of them stole money, and
these must be spanked. After these exceptions have
been made there will be a few left and they have lived
such a deuce of a life that we will let them go.</p>

<p class='c015'>There does not seem to be any great harm in the man
who saved in order that he might keep out of the almshouse
when he grew too old to work. We should not
tax these people, either, if they have only moderate
means. Our wise legislators, however, do not seem to
think so. Many cases of this kind have been heard of
during and since the late unpleasantness where the poor
souls had a hard time keeping body and spirit together
after the tax collector was through with them.</p>

<p class='c015'>All farmers who have made money should be let off,
provided they made money by real farming and not by
selling fancy cattle, poultry, etc., at startling prices. Real
farming is a man’s job, and those who succeed at it deserve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>to be patted on the back. The fellows who sell
the blooded stock belong in about the same class as the
bond salesman—we will come to these later on.</p>

<p class='c015'>The married couples who bring up and properly educate,
say four or more children, are also deserving. If
their children are grateful so much the better; if they
chip in and support their father and mother—fine! In
the last case we might safely except everybody concerned.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of course we must except the lame, the halt and the
blind; and perhaps a few others have been unintentionally
skipped, but there seem to be few others. Now we
come to those who need punishment of some kind.</p>

<p class='c015'>First among these are the office-holders. There are
a few among them who really earn all they get—but
not many. Office holding ought to be made a dangerous
business, and running for the Presidency punished with
death.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bankers ought to be periodically inspected and made
to give an account of themselves, so should lawyers,
and real-estate agents. The doctors, some of them, need
watching. They are a frightfully jealous lot and outside
testimony only, can be relied on. If a good one is
found he should be patted on the back. There are a lot
of these but most of them live in the country where the
air is good. Those who live in the city and have hospitals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>where they charge $100.00 for opening a pimple
and $25.00 for giving you four ounces of ether should
be heavily docked and then fined.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are far too many wholesale and retail merchants
and too few farmers. We might well cut out half of the
merchants for a start and make them move out on farms
where they could be really useful. If they commit suicide
instead of farming, so much the better. There are
also too many book agents and bond salesmen and
brokers and clerks in stores. Too many newspapers are
published and too much paper wasted in doing it. This
needs regulating. The best way to do it is to tax these
things and let the farmers alone for the present, until
they have $5.00 ahead.</p>

<p class='c015'>And the fellows who are loafing around waiting for
a bonus should be put to a painless death. They will
never be of any real use. The labor agitators and strike
leaders are in the way, too.</p>

<p class='c015'>Anybody who spends his time loafing or playing golf
should be stopped, questioned and put to work. If he
refuses he should be shipped off to an island set apart
for the purpose where he must work or starve.</p>

<p class='c015'>All such wealthy ones should be treated as indicated
and some of those not wealthy but who belong to the
same classes need much the same treatment.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>While we are about it we may perhaps just as well
do a little more regulating. The Germans, for example,
have too many children and the French too few. We
should take warning and govern ourselves accordingly.
Of course some people claim that these things are regulated
by Providence but it seems probable that there are
other forces at work. Four children to a family seems
to be about right and it is suggested that a committee, all
the members of which have done their full duty and are
from Missouri, be appointed to see that there are no
slackers. This is a species of wealth that needs regulating
as well as other kinds.</p>

<p class='c015'>The old maids and old bachelors should be heavily
taxed unless they can satisfy a Missouri committee that
they have made determined efforts to commit matrimony.
In that case they should have assistance.</p>

<p class='c015'>All would-be voters should be carefully examined before
it is allowed and the recall and repeal should be
in order. Every voter should be able to spell his or her
name, tell what rivers run through and by Easton, where
the Atlantic is situated and what Sing Sing is noted for.
After all are educated up to this point, the tests should
gradually be toughened until only those really fit can
vote. They should be <i>made</i> to vote every time. Gradually,
in this way, every man can learn how to milk cows,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>husk corn, run a plow and chase the pigs out of the
oats. The women will be able to darn stockings, bake
bread, sew shirts and run a bridge party.</p>

<p class='c015'>By the time these ideas are put to work the <a id='tn118'></a>millennium
will be close at hand and we need no longer flee from the
tax gatherer or hide from the bond salesman.</p>

  <h2 id='ch_17' class='c010'>The Skin of the Bear</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>This story, according to De Comines, was told by the
Emperor Frederick III of Germany to an emissary of
King Louis XI of France who wished him to conspire
against the Duke of Burgundy to their mutual advantage:</p>

<p class='c015'>Two ne’er-do-wells living in the interior of Germany
had patronized the local inn keeper without paying his bill
until the latter became weary. He finally told them
that he would give them no more credit. They soon became
hungry, thirsty and desperate, and consulted together
as to how they might once more establish their
credit. While engaged in thus scheming their hunger
and thirst steadily increased until it became overpowering.
Now you must know that the villagers had been
greatly harried by a monstrous big black bear who, from
the adjoining forest, ravaged their flocks and their gardens.
He was especially fond of sheep and almost
nightly carried off and devoured them. Nothing was any
longer safe in the village night or day and large rewards
were offered to anyone who would kill him and thus
save them from loss. This was known to the two bums
who proceeded to make use of it with the good natured
landlord. They told him if he would only give them
enough to eat and drink to appease their hunger and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>thirst they would at once go in search of the bear and
proceed to kill him and take off his hide. This, they
assured the inn keeper, was an enormous hide and its
sale would yield a large sum which they proposed to use
in extinguishing their debt and any future advances he
might see fit to make. This was not all; with the rewards
they would collect they should become opulent, and they
promised to spend this at his house, so that all this
money would in the long run come to him alone. The
tavern keeper was of an optimistic turn of mind and
listened to their tale with renewed hope, finally agreeing
to do as they asked. The two conspirators, as soon as
they had filled their bellies started out in quest of the
bear. Now it happened that bruin had become hungry
earlier than usual that evening and that he had started
to forage earlier. After eating several ears of corn
which he took from a field alongside the road he hurried
along in the gathering dusk toward the village. The
adventurers were headed in the opposite direction on the
same road and they rapidly drew together. The bear
was the first to detect their approach with a loud Whoof!
This startled the bums and frightened them very badly.
Without the least delay, the eldest promptly took to a
tree which, fortunately for him, spread its branches close
by the road. The second loafer was so badly frightened
that he fell down in a dead faint and lay upon the ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>without motion. Without hesitating the bear trotted up
and smelled the man by putting his nose to the latter’s
ear. Finding no motion, and thinking the man dead, the
bear, after taking several sniffs and turning the fellow
over with a thrust of its paw, proceeded on its way.
After a short time the tree climber descended and ran
off as fast as his legs could carry him. The man who
had fainted presently recovered and proceeded to do
likewise. Seeing his friend scampering along at a great
pace some distance ahead he hailed him and his friend
stopped and allowed him to come up. Together they
proceeded toward the town and related their tale to the
landlord, not without much embellishment. The tavern
keeper finally agreed, in consideration of the difficulty
of their task, to give a further extension of credit. But
the tree climber was dissatisfied and proceeded to question
his fellow bum. “What did the bear ask you,”
said he, “when he whispered in your ear?” His mate
replied: “He did not whisper to me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes he did,” said the first, “he whispered in your
ear for some time. Did I not see him do it? Try not to
deceive me, it will be in vain.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Now the faint-hearted one was also a wit and he,
therefore, hesitated and finally confessed that something
had passed, but declared he was not obliged to divulge
it. This made the first bum angry and he assailed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>fellow with threats and reproaches. But still the latter
declined to divulge the secret. This led to renewed
threats and finally to blows. The possessor of the
secret was vanquished and finally agreed to tell it to his
fellow, but only in the presence of the landlord and the
village magistrate. It was also agreed that after telling
the secret he should be allowed to go free without further
molestation. To this clause the landlord, whose curiosity
had been aroused, also agreed; further, he promised to
protect the possessor of the secret. These details having
been arranged the parties met one morning in the house
of the magistrate. The second vagabond first recited the
agreement and having procured the assent of all parties
began as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>“When Bruin appeared I was frightened and fell in a
faint. From this I was awakened by a rough tongue
licking my cheek and a bearish voice whispering in my
ear. It said: ‘You were to kill me were you not, and to
take off my hide and sell it? And you were to collect
the money offered as rewards, and having thus acquired
much money you agreed, did you not, to pay the account
of the landlord and stay with him until your money was
exhausted?’</p>

<p class='c015'>“I was badly frightened and, thinking my time had
come and resolving to endanger my hope of salvation by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>no more lies, I nodded my head in assent. The bear then
said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“‘Very well, <a id='tn123'></a>you are properly punished. As for the
rascal in the tree the inn keeper has made no agreement
with him such as that he will make with you; and when
you have escaped his wrath I advise him to clap him in
jail. In the meantime I will advise you both never in
future to sell the hide of a bear before you have killed it,
nor would I collect rewards for its death before the
death takes place.’ As for the Judge, he is a rascal anyhow
and at all times, and is well able to take care of himself.”
With this the vagabond darted from the room
and ran up the street pursued by all three who had forgotten
their promises in their resentment. He however
made good his escape.</p>

  <h2 id='ch_18' class='c010'>A Visit from the Wileys</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>Many years ago, shortly after I began teaching at
Lafayette College, I determined to join The American
Association for the Advancement of Science. This long-winded
name was given by themselves to a collection of
bookworms who every year assembled in some good-sized
city, after having collected some thousands of dollars
for expenses of the local merchants, and held as
many as a dozen pow wows in as many different rooms.
In one of these rooms a learned discussion on one or
more mathematical questions was kept up during most of
the hours of daylight; in a second, subjects in physics
were undergoing examination; a third room was occupied
by the chemists, a fourth by the biologists; everywhere
there was a sprinkling of “nuts” who were in
danger of breaking out and must be sat upon in order not
to discredit the serious minded.</p>

<p class='c015'>The discussions sometimes dropped into a burst of self-admiration
by some savant devoted to the holy cause of
science who was keeping the lamp of knowledge burning
in poverty and distress. These wails were occasionally
broken in upon by another wholesome-minded soul, like
the great Cope, who boldly declared that he was not suffering
but having a good time and could be happy in no
other way.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>In the evenings some of us put on our best clothes
and attended a garden party given by a local magnate
where we met the money bags of the neighborhood and
for an hour breathed the unaccustomed air of luxury;
or we attended an evening lecture given by some member
of the attending band of scientists in compliment to the
hosts; a chosen few assembled at a room where good
beer was to be had, in ordinary dress, drank a little beer
and listened to stories and discussions straight from the
shoulder and worth while.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was in these evening discussions and in daylight
visits to points of geological or other interest that we became
acquainted and learned to enjoy the great week
of the year. It was here that I first met Le Conte, Cope,
Major Powell, the one-armed explorer of the Colorado
canyon, Brashear, who made his first lenses from tumbler
bottoms and Wiley, the jolly farmer giant, <i>facile princeps</i>
among men.</p>

<p class='c015'>I believe I first met Wiley at Buffalo in August, 1886.
We visited Niagara together as part of a jolly crowd
and had a happy day. Nearly every year for many years
after I met Wiley at these meetings. I also met him
elsewhere. He came to Easton nearly every year for
awhile to lecture to my students. The lecture room was
large enough to hold the audience at first, but as he became
better known we moved over to Pardee Hall into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>a room large enough to hold the crowd that came to
enjoy the treat. Presently the “old man,” as we called
him, was asked to go to Lehigh whenever he came to
Lafayette. I always went up with him and listened
again. His lectures were always new, never twice the
same.</p>

<p class='c015'>On one occasion he wrote me asking whether he might
spend an extra day with me and I gladly acceded. We
rode all day through the hills and woods over Scott’s
Mountain and had a jolly day. When the attempt to
pass pure food legislation became strenuous Frear and
I conspired in its behalf and carried our point. When
he became President of the American Chemical Society
he chose me as editor and we toiled together at the heavy
task. Afterwards I printed and published his great work
on Agricultural Chemical Analysis. In all this work and
play he was the kind, indulgent older brother.</p>

<p class='c015'>For many years he led the lonely imperfect life of a
bachelor until he had reached the ripe age of 62 when
his love of many years yielded to his wishes and they
were married. I shall never forget the glad smile on his
face as my wife and I came up to congratulate them and
he realized that we had traveled all the way from Easton
to wish him joy.</p>

<p class='c015'>Upon a later occasion we visited Washington with a
large party of chemists and, with many others were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>guests of Dr. and Mrs. Wiley at a dinner at the Raleigh.
But we had the advantage of most of the other guests,
for we were admitted behind the scenes before the dinner
came off. Mrs. Wiley and Nan Pierce, Dr. Wiley’s Secretary,
told us about some of the funny things that had
occurred. Dr. Wiley was away from home and they
were forced to make all the arrangements. They knew
only a few of his friends and succeeded in inviting several
dead people to the feast.</p>

<p class='c015'>Upon another occasion we were in Washington with
a party of Rotarians and the Wileys invited us to dinner
at their home in Ashmead Place. Here we met the
Wiley boys, Harvey Jr. and John, for the first time,
while my wife told us, to our great joy, how, by a series
of amusing misunderstandings, she had narrowly escaped
being a guest at one of Mrs. Harding’s private parties.
In the evening we attended a literary soiree with Dr.
and Mrs. Wiley and greatly enjoyed the papers read and
the chaff that formed a part. It was a real literary treat.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then we learned that his eyesight was failing and
that he was soon to be operated upon for cataract. The
day of the operation passed and we had no news. We
dare not telegraph for fear the operation had not succeeded.
Thus a week passed. At last we learned that
he saw once more though not so well as of old.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>We saw Dr. Wiley again at the Golden Wedding of
Dr. and Mrs. W. H. Nichols at Sherry’s last winter.
Dr. Wiley seemed well and in good spirits. We saw comparatively
little of him here because so many of his
friends were present and each claimed a share of his
time.</p>

<p class='c015'>Several months later a letter arrived telling us that
the family expected to start for Cambridge, Mass.,
shortly, where Wiley was to attend the fiftieth reunion
of his class at Harvard. They would arrive in Easton
in the evening by auto and would spend the night with
us. I immediately replied that the road up College Hill
was closed for repairs and that they must telephone me
on arrival and allow me to join and pilot them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Accordingly, at 8 P. M. the telephone rang and Mrs.
Wiley’s voice announced their arrival. They were dusty
and tired and soon after dinner retired to rest.</p>

<p class='c015'>We have quite a good-sized house but the family is
large and only two extra rooms were available. One of
these contained a large wooden bedstead heavy and
strong enough to support a hippopotamus; this was
dedicated to Dr. and Mrs. Wiley. The other room had
a large brass bedstead which had been used for many
years. Originally it had been well and strong; but long
continued use by our four stocky boys as a spring-board
and general exercise ground had weakened our confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>in its ability to sustain heavy weights. We
thought, however, it would surely sustain the two boys.
After they had all retired and it was too late to interfere,
from sundry movements and murmurings overhead,
it became evident that a readjustment had taken
place and that Dr. Wiley and his huskiest son were in
the weak bed while Nan and the younger boy occupied
the bed for elephants. We listened in dreadful suspense
for a breakdown. Fortunately none came and the extra
weight was safely carried.</p>

<p class='c015'>For ten days we heard nothing of the Wileys and then
they drove up on their way home. They had had a wonderful
time at Harvard and on the way home. On the
way they stopped at a country hotel and John had
climbed up to the peak of the roof and was unable to
get down. Then he called to his father for help and that
hard-hearted parent refused to assist him for some time
but finally relented.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Hart had no help in the kitchen and the Doctor
thought they had better not stop but I persuaded him
otherwise. I said: “We want you to stay. We will let
you help us and will dispense with all frills. I have so
arranged that Mrs. Hart shall not be overworked and
shall be able to enjoy your visit.” On that understanding
they consented to stay. The next day was Thursday,
the meeting day of our Rotary Club, and the Doctor, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Wiley boys and my own four boys were my guests at the
Rotary lunch. They made quite an array, and there was
much quiet amusement as they filed in and sat down.
After the lunch Dr. Wiley was called upon to speak and
made us a short address—such a happy talk as only
Wiley can make.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the meantime Mrs. Wiley and Dr. Kate De Witt
Miesse, our family physician and a friend of Mrs. Wiley,
and my wife, were dining at the Pomfret Club, guests of
my wife. Behind the curtains that night I heard the
story from my wife of how her two guests discoursed on
woman’s rights while she sat and listened and enjoyed
the fun.</p>

<p class='c015'>That night at dinner we had ice cream and cake for
dessert, and the boys brought in the towering piece of
cream fresh from the can. It towered above my wife
as she sliced off the portions and finally toppled over
on the platter. Mrs. Wiley had been watching it in nervous
terror, and as it went over she screamed and
shouted: “My soul and body!” much to our amusement.
The Doctor informed us that for a moderate surprise she
called: “My soul!” but great occasions called for: “My
soul and body!”</p>

<p class='c015'>The next day was raining and we were not able to
visit the farm as we had planned but spent the day at
home resting. The following day was beautiful and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>had an early breakfast that they might be soon on the
road. The topic somehow shifted to the question of
woman’s rights and the Doctor proceeded to tell us how,
in pursuit of these rights, his wife had become a criminal
and been hustled to the gaol while her devoted family
were scouring the country to find her.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had been persecuting Mr. Wilson, he said, and
merited their sad fate but he thought she had no business
to leave three hopeless orphans stranded as she had.
We all laughed and almost screamed with delight as the
story proceeded.</p>

<p class='c015'>After breakfast the Doctor begged us to go part way
with them. They expected to stop at Valley Forge and
they wanted us to go too. We finally agreed to go. At
Doylestown my auto shed a tire and we sent for the
garage man while we lunched in the shade of the trees.
It was determined to leave my machine while I was to
ride with my wife or with the Wileys. Then Mrs.
Wiley cornered me and said I must not strike or push a
lady while the Doctor paid the garage man.</p>

<p class='c015'>When I tried to get in my wife’s car I found all the
boys there; of course they wanted to be together, so I
got in with the Wileys. We drove around Valley Forge
Park and enjoyed the beauty of the spot and reminded
ourselves of the poor soldiers, freezing and starving the
winter away, and proceeded to climb the tower. John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>went ahead and reached the very top before his mother
spied him and then she once more screamed: “My soul
and body!”</p>

<p class='c015'>My boys were very fond of Mrs. Wiley. So was I
until I became aware of the disaffection she had stirred
up. Previous to this visit my wife had been obedient,
as all wives should be, but now she began to speak up.
She told us Mrs. Wiley said that every wife who took
care of her man and his children was self supporting and
had a <i>right</i> to share his wealth if he had any. This is
dreadful doctrine as all but the depraved must agree. I
am wondering whether we had better have Mrs. Wiley
again?</p>

  <h2 id='ch_19' class='c010'>In the Days of the Roses</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>In the days of good King Harry the Sixth there was
bitter strife in all the land between the houses of York
and Lancaster. The adherents of one house oppressed,
robbed and even murdered the adherents of the other.
Political hatred grew apace and filled the land with civil
wars. Houses were burned, churches were robbed and
cattle were lifted. No one was sure of his life or property.
Landless men were organized as bands of robbers
making the highways unsafe. As a direct consequence of
this waste of life and treasure the French lands won by
Edward the Third, his son, the Black Prince, and Harry
the Fifth were rapidly lost by the incapable Duke of Suffolk
until only Calais and a strip of territory in the south
of France remained.</p>

<p class='c015'>With all his goodness the sixth Henry was but a feeble
king, not ruling but ruled by his imperious wife and
rugged, warlike barons. These were the days in which
printing was invented, when armor was becoming useless
before the advance of gunpowder and the introduction
of firearms. The feudal system had entered upon its
decay; superstition reigned but Lollardism under
Wyckliffe had begun to undermine Roman Catholicism.
The results of that terrible scourge, The Black Death,
which swept Europe in 1347 carrying off a third of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>population, were still felt in the scarcity of labor and
higher wages.</p>

<p class='c015'>Twenty miles northwest of London in the little town
of St. Albans a fire broke out one day in June, 1440, in an
old house in Dagnal Lane. It was a poor quarter and
there was a loud outcry as the inhabitants began carrying
their scanty belongings to safer places. The watch
came clattering down the street with their leather fire
buckets and formed a line to the nearest well which was
soon bailed dry. No attempt was made to save the
burning house; efforts were confined to keeping the fire
from spreading. Suddenly a woman screamed: “there
are children in the house!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Body o’ me,” said Jed Fenchurch to his wife, “gie me
thy apron!” Wrapping it around his face he dashed
through the half open door, out of which smoke was
pouring and presently emerged, choking, panting and
cursing with a child on each arm, both unconscious.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thou art surely a brave one,” said his wife, Lisbeth,
proudly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Pook, woman!” said Jed, “should I let un die? Body
o’ me!”</p>

<p class='c015'>But she was busy with the children, washing their
faces with her apron and giving them water to drink.
Presently the children struggled back to consciousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and began to cry, first the boy, then the girl. He might
be three years old, but the girl was only a baby.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wanth mine nurth,” sobbed the boy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He hath no hurt,” said Lisbeth, “but, oh Jed, thy poor
hands!”</p>

<p class='c015'>They were, indeed, badly scorched and painful. His
hair was singed, his eyebrows gone and his ears blistered
but no serious harm had been suffered. When Lisbeth
had attended to his burns she picked up the children
and carried them to her house hard by.</p>

<p class='c015'>On the morrow, when the ashes were raked the bones
of a woman were discovered. The landlord of the
Checquers said he had let the house but the day before
to one Mary Smith who had paid a month’s rent in advance.
He knew nothing of her nor whence she came.
Jed and Lisbeth kept the children; they were childless
and well to do. There was no formal adoption. The
children were supposed to be brother and sister. He
said his name was Don, which was interpreted as John,
and that her name was Banch, which was interpreted as
Blanche.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jed Fenchurch was an armorer, which a writer of that
day has called the least mean of mean occupations. His
shop at the back of the house, in a building entered by a
passage way alongside. Here the children delighted to
play and John helped as he was able as he grew stronger.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Both attended the Abbey school and were well educated
for those days, when the scholar was a man who could
read and write.</p>

<p class='c015'>John naturally heard much about feats of arms and
was taught at first hand the uses of arms and armor. He
learned to use the long bow, and as he developed into
young manhood, and his arm grew long and his muscles
tough and strong, he drew his arrows to the nock. This
weapon was then the arm of most reliance and its development,
together with the use of dismounted cavalry,
developed by Edward III and the Black Prince, the cause
of the English strength.</p>

<p class='c015'>Neither was Blanche neglected. Her foster mother,
Lisbeth, had also been foster mother to the great Earl
of Warwick and had learned much of gentle ways in the
great castle. Many of these she imparted to Blanche,
and was much blamed by her gossips for raising the
child in ways above her station.</p>

<p class='c015'>There came a day when the great Earl visited his
foster mother. His visit was marked by festivities given
by the holy fathers of the Abbey in his honor, where
barrels of beer were broached and beeves were roasted
whole. The Earl was a tall, well-built man of handsome
presence and kindly mien, much beloved by gentle and
common. He first greeted and kissed his old nurse; the
children were then presented. John’s height and reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of arm earned his commendation. “I will even take him
into my service, an you wish,” said he.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Right gladly will he come, your highness,” said Lisbeth,
“you are good to your old nurse and her ward;
God will reward you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not so,” said the Earl, “I but find a fine bowman.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“’Tis a fine deed, natheless, John,” said Lisbeth when
the Earl had departed, “and but shows the kind heart;
but thou art the lucky boy! In all England lives no
greater; and he will watch and guard thee; thou art indeed
fortunate. Do I not know and love him?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Surely,” said John, “I must do my best, more I cannot.
Truly, thou art good to me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Alas, and shall I see thee no more? Wilt thou indeed
leave us?” said Blanche, tears filling her eyes.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not so, sweetheart,” John replied, “when I go I shall
soon return. How could I forsake thee, silly?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The summons to arms was not long delayed. One
evening in early May an express arrived at the Checquers
and enquired for Jed Fenchurch. He was directed to
the house on Dagnal Lane and informed Jed that he
came from Warwick with directions to the bowmen,
spearmen and men at arms to assemble at Royston and
there await the arrival of the Duke of York and his
own men.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>There were but few Yorkists in St. Albans, but a
party of bowmen, including Jed, John and three others
were on their way afoot early the next morning, while
the messenger continued his journey towards London.</p>

<p class='c015'>“’Tis thretty good mile,” said fat Steve Balderstone
in a thin voice, “I mind me when I walked as much in
a day with good King Harry the Fift, but I were young
then and light of foot. Truly the Duke moveth but
slowly and we needs must wait at Royston. Why then
shall we go apace?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Pook, thou elephant! the duke moveth at the gallop
and the Earl also. Tarry not or ye may rue it,” said Jed.
“Listen not to this squeaker. Body <a id='tn138a'></a>o’ me! we mun go
apace.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I will blow thee to York with one puff, thou pot
mender,” squeaked Steve.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Truly, thou art a fine blower,” said Jed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Tarry a bit!” said John to Jabez <a id='tn138b'></a>Stout in a whisper,
“see but the birds.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And, in truth, over a wood to the right the birds were
wheeling as the boys fell back and fitted an arrow to the
string. From the wood three men on horseback drove
rapidly into the road and galloped toward them.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They are robbers,” said John, “take thou the one on
the left” and their bows twanged and the arrows whistled.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>The <a id='tn139a'></a>horseman on the right was transfixed by John’s
shaft which pierced his right shoulder, and he fell from
his horse which turned and fled. Jabez was not so fortunate;
his shaft flew not so truly, but it caught the
skin of the left leg of the rider and imbedded itself in the
horse beneath which screamed and lashed out in agony,
throwing the rider. The third horseman turned and
galloped away. The rider of the stricken horse crawled
into the bushes from which he was quickly hauled and
despatched, after which the men gathered around the
man desperately wounded.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mercy! mercy! Sir John,” shrieked the stricken man
looking at John, “Spare me! spare me! I am not fit to
die!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“<a id='tn139b'></a>Thou wilt die, sure enough,” said Steve, “thy right
lung is shot through, but why call him Sir John? ’Tis
but John Fenchurch.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“’Tis the ghost of Sir John Jernyngan whom I stabbed
at Bordeaux. Mercy! mercy!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He raves,” said Steve, “get along, John, out of his
sight.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Leave him with me,” said Jed. “I would speak with
him further.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“’Tis as he told thee,” said Jed to the dying man when
they were alone. “It was John Fenchurch.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“I tell thee no!” he replied. “’Twas Sir John Jernyngan
or his ghost.<a id='tn140'></a> Thinkest thou I know not mine old
enemy who stole my honors and my bride? Did I not see
the old Duke of Warwick knight him at Savignies?”
This was followed by a gush of blood as his spirit fled.
Jed dragged the body to the roadside, rifled the pockets
and followed the others, deep in thought.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>II. <span class='sc'>In the Forest</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>They camped with others at Royston until the arrival
of the three Richards: Richard of York, Richard of
Warwick and Richard of Salisbury, on May 20. Two
days later found the Yorkists encamped outside St.
Albans, with the Lancastrians in the town. After much
parleying the Yorkists advanced to the attack. The
Duke of York led on one wing, the Earl of Salisbury on
the other, while John was with the Earl of Warwick in
the center. The palisades at this point were old and
rotten and the ditch dry. They were soon passed and
the defenders driven back or killed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come with me, Jabez,” said John as they advanced,
“I know a way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Surely, at the side of the house next the Checquers,
the side door at the stairway where we met Rhoda,” said
Jabez.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Aye,” said John, “but go quietly along by the bushes
that we be not seen.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>But they were seen, and an arrow found lodging in
Jabez’ breast, who fell, while John reached and passed
behind a projecting buttress that hid a small doorway.
This opened on a stair, up which he passed to a window
fronting on Checquers Street where he posted himself
and began shooting at the Lancastrians in the street
below. He had been closely followed by numerous
archers and several men at arms. The archers posted
themselves at the other windows while the men at arms
broke into the rooms below, killed those posted there and
issued forth into the street from the doorway. Presently
Richard of Warwick issued forth into the street and led
the fighting while other Yorkist archers broke into the
houses on the other side of the street and shot from the
windows, all the while shouting: “A Warwick! a Warwick!”
Here you saw one fall with his brains dashed
out, there another with a broken arm, a third with a
cut throat and a fourth with a pierced chest, and the
whole street was full of dead corpses.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c020'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>As the Lancastrians broke and fled in confusion, John
remembered Lisbeth and Blanche, unprotected. There
was his place of duty. Straightway he descended and
pushed his way along the crowded road to the house in
Dagnal Lane in time to head the rabble who, crazed with
blood and drink, had begun to sack the town.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“Come with me!” he called to the frightened pair,
bursting in at the door, “but bring warm clothing; we
must even sleep afield this night.” So saying he hurriedly
filled a basket, caught up some wraps and started northward
toward an angle of the palisade and ditch.</p>

<p class='c015'>The flight of the vanquished was in three directions:
Northwest toward Dunstable, along Watling Street,
North toward Harpenden and southwest toward Watford.</p>

<p class='c015'>Breaking down some palisades, John helped the women
over the ditch and the three ran toward the shelter of
the forest. This gained, he helped them climb into the
arms of an ancient beech, where they lay concealed while
the pursued and pursuers thundered by down the road
on either side, and a scattering few stole through the
underbrush below and around them.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the night fell it grew colder, and Blanche crept into
his arms, laid her head confidingly against his shoulder
and slept. The sleep of all three was, however, somewhat
broken by the noises made by the peasantry searching
with torches for the bodies of the slain.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the morning, all danger having passed, John helped
the women down and the three returned to their home
which was in great disorder and bare of everything of
value. It was a sad homecoming for the women, but it
was useless to repine, so they set to work to clean the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>house and put it in order. John was informed that the
Earl of Warwick desired his immediate attendance. “Is
it true,” the Earl demanded, “that you led the archers
up the stairway?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, your Lordship,” said John, “I knew of the door
and the stairway of old.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was a great deed and shall not be forgotten, choose
thy reward!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“To serve your Lordship,” said John.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well said,” returned the Earl, “thou shalt be my
page.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“An your Lordship please, I would first bury Jabez
Short who was killed beside me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So do,” replied the Earl, “I will send for thee anon.”</p>

<p class='c015'>John encountered Jed on his return; “do thou look
after the women folk,” said Jed, “I must straight to
London with the Earl.”</p>

<p class='c015'>That morning the Duke of Norfolk marched into St.
Albans with 6,000 men and the army started for London
with the wounded King, who had been struck on the
neck with an arrow.</p>

<p class='c015'>Several days passed by before Jed could reach the
Earl who was much engaged. In the meantime he was
able to reach the Countess, Anne Beauchamp, who was
the daughter of Richard Beauchamp, the former Duke,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>and sister of Henry, Duke of Warwick, from whom she
had inherited.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Countess informed Jed that she remembered Sir
John Jernyngan, who was still living and well. He was
a fine, upstanding man, tall, straight, with dark, somewhat
curly hair and blue eyes. She remembered well
how her father, who was the very flower of chivalry, and
a gallant soldier, had knighted him for his gallant deeds
on the field at Savignies. Lady Jernyngan was the
daughter of Sir Everard Herbert of Bromhill in Hereford.
Her hand had also been sought by one Victor
Bozen, a soldier of fortune whose description was identical
with that of the dead robber. It was true that he
had the assurance to demand her hand in marriage, but
the lady had openly scorned him, and in revenge he had
stabbed her successful suitor who had never harmed him.
She rejoiced that his son—for she doubted not John was
his son—had unknowingly revenged the foul deed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Romance, then as now, greatly appeals to the gentle
mind. Anne became greatly interested in John and took
him under her special protection. She became his advocate
with the Earl, where he needed no advocate, and
shielded him from the jibes and petty tyrannies of the
pages at Warwick—her own castle—where he spent
eighteen months perfecting himself in arms and chivalry.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>On his first visit home after a six months’ absence,
Blanche flew at him, threw herself into his arms and
kissed him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have news for thee, sweetheart,” said John, “my
Lady has discovered”—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” said Blanche, “what hath she discovered?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I had better not tell thee, ’twill make thee unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nay, tell me!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Give me first six kisses!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There then, thou silly. Now tell me!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My, thy lips are sweet! She thinks thou art no sister
of mine.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh John, how dreadful!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So I thought at first, but not now. We may wed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh no! How could we?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We may and will. Now give me some more kisses.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not so. If I am no sister why kiss? Too many have
I given thee already.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My Lady says thou art Blanche Wychyngham, the
daughter of Sir Edmund Wychyngham of Norfolk, and
that we were stolen and carried off by my nurse who
was a sister of that Victor Bozen I slew on the way to
Royston. He had a grudge against thy father also.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh John! how dreadful. I cannot bear it.” And she
ran off to her foster mother in tears.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the morrow came a letter bidding John join the
Earl at Calais. Shortly thereafter Blanche left St.
Albans to visit her father and sisters.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among the Paston Letters is one from John Jernyngan
to his cousin, Margaret Paston, which is here reproduced
with all the quaint spelling of those days:</p>

<div class='c022'><span class='sc'>John Jernyngan</span>.</div>

<p class='c018'>The engagement with the Spaniards related in this
letter was looked upon as a victory by the English. The
next year there was another naval battle in which after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>a running two days’ chase three out of five Genoese and
Spanish ships were captured and brought into Calais, and
Warwick became a naval hero to his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c015'>On June 24, 1460, with Salisbury and March, Warwick
landed at Sandwich, which Fauconberg had previously
captured and held for the Duke of York. John Jernyngan,
as we must now call him, was of course of the party.
On July 2 they were in London, and on the 10th their
army faced the army of the Red Rose in the meadows
near Northampton.</p>

<p class='c015'>The King’s position was well protected by the crude
artillery of that day, but there was a heavy rain storm
and the pieces could not be discharged. The Lord Grey
of Ruthven turned traitor to the King and assisted the
advance of the young Earl of March who soon opened
the way for the Yorkists. Buckingham, Shrewsbury,
Beaumont, Egremont and Sir William Lucy with three
hundred other Lords, knights and squires were killed
and Henry was captured and taken to London.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1461, John was present at the rout of the Yorkists
at the second battle of St. Albans and escaped with difficulty.
In March of the same year he also took part in
the decisive battle of Towton where the hopes of Henry
the sixth and his Queen found their grave. This was a
fiercely fought field where the mallets of lead crushed
many a skull. In the nick of time the troops of the Duke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>of Norfolk arrived and the Lancastrians broke and fled.
John had been in the front of the fighting, towering
above the heads of the other knights and esquires with
the exception of the new King Edward IV who was a
mighty man and handsome. The slaughter was terrible.
“No Quarter!” was the order, and most of those
captured were promptly beheaded.</p>

<p class='c015'>After the pursuit was at an end John returned to
Saxton where he found the King who said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thou art a valiant soldier. Kneel!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then he smote John gently on the back with his sword
and said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Rise, Sir John Jernyngan! The field is won. Go
now to thy people in Norfolk.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It may be imagined that this command of the King was
promptly obeyed. When John arrived he discovered that
the news of his new honor had preceded him. There
were great rejoicings in which Blanche participated. To
her he seemed a different man—older, more sedate, of
greater knowledge, more to be admired and respected.
She began to wonder what were his thoughts? and
above all what he thought of her, but he gave at first no
sign. In fact the slaughter after the battle had sobered
him. It was borne in upon him that the King was cruel
and that trouble must come. From boy he had become
a man, accustomed to command and self-reliant. Like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>the moth near the flame Blanche was attracted and then
repelled. She began to dream, and he figured in her
dreams. She was a beautiful girl, much courted and a
trifle spoiled, but John seemed to her stronger, handsomer
and better than her other men friends. He never
wavered in kindness but said little. She became bolder
and he met her advances. Soon she found herself hopelessly
in love.</p>

<p class='c015'>In those days love was not alone the concern of the
lovers. Fathers and mothers, often overlords, and even
sometimes the King, must be consulted. When all these
tedious matters had been arranged there was a great
wedding at Warwick Castle, where Anne insisted the
ceremony must be performed. The Bishop of Canterbury
said mass and married the couple in the presence
of the King, the Earl of Warwick and many of the
nobility.</p>

<p class='c015'>After their marriage several years of peace followed.
Then more strife and blood with the struggle between
Edward and Warwick, the return of Henry for a brief
period, the fight at Barnet and the death of Warwick, the
accession of Richard III and his brief and bloody career
ending in the fight and his death on Bosworth Field.
With the accession of Henry VII, the wars of the roses
were at an end; peace returned and our story ends.</p>

</div>
<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c014'>In the year 1903 I bought my first automobile. It
was a Ford. Even as early as that the inimitable Henry
was at work; but this car was quite unlike the modern
Ford. It had double opposed cylinders placed horizontally
on either side of the crankshaft which was in the
middle and in the fore and aft axis of the machine. The
engine was said to develop eight horsepower—perhaps
it did. There was a front seat for two passengers and
two corner seats for two more in the small tonneau
back of it. The tonneau was entered by a narrow door
in the middle of the back; below it was a step to enable
the passengers to get up and down. There was no cover.
The car was painted a brilliant red.</p>

<p class='c015'>I was very much elated over my new car which had
been carefully tested before I bought it. The salesman,
who was also the mechanic, drove me over all the rough
roads and steep hills in the vicinity. I drove it down
one of these steep hills myself to test the brakes. Under
all these tests the car behaved very well, but I soon
found that a good-sized repair bill was a necessary part
of the program. I also found myself gaining a profound
respect for the mechanic, that is for some mechanics.
I also discovered that it was necessary to spend
three hours looking for the source of any trouble and
but three minutes in fixing it.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>There was a beautiful drive along the river. Every
evening after my working day was over and I had had
supper (we did not call it dinner) I was in the habit of
driving several miles down the river and back before
the night shut in. In case I lingered and the darkness
overtook me there was a brilliant headlight in the front
of the car making the pathway as light as day. Usually
some young lady of my acquaintance accompanied me
on these drives. I was also fond of riding on Sunday
afternoons. I asked Mrs. Henry to go with me one
Sunday afternoon but she refused—she said it was
wicked to take rides on Sunday.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You might say that if I were driving a horse or an
ass or anything that was my <a id='tn152'></a>neighbor’s, Mrs. Henry,”
said I, “but I am driving a soulless machine and it belongs
to me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I don’t know very well just what the ins and
outs are,” she replied, “but I don’t feel right when I go
out driving on Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Henry smiled—I knew he did not feel that much
respect for Sunday—but when I asked him to go he declined;
said he had a lot of writing to do, but I thought
he was afraid.</p>

<p class='c015'>I was determined to go and did not want to go alone.
There was a baker’s daughter living on the same street.
She was a very pretty girl, with a beautiful complexion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and wonderful eyes. She had a smile and a kind word
for everybody. When I asked her whether she would
like to go she said: “yes she would, very much.” Now,
that is what I like in a girl; I like a girl who knows her
own mind.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sally was a quiet girl, usually, but that afternoon she
had a great deal to say. When she spoke she smiled at
me, and she did not say a single unkind thing during
the ride. I was very much pleased with Sally. I thought
it would be nice to have her around all the time. I determined
to take her again that evening; her mother told
me, however, that she had gone to church with Jim
Barkley. Jim was a bank cashier. He was getting
a good salary and dressed very well. I looked at Mrs.
Lunn with considerable interest. She was a very nice
woman and her complexion was good, for she lived over
a bakery, and spent much of her time in it. I had noticed
that bakers and singers always had good complexions
and were fat. Mrs. Lunn was fat, too—very fat. As I
looked at her I said to myself: “that is how Sally will
look in a few years,” and a chill stole over me.</p>

<p class='c015'>I was living at a boarding house at this time. Several
other members of the college faculty also boarded there.
The food was pretty good but we were not very well
satisfied. The dining table was rather small and was so
full of dishes that the coffee pot was placed on the floor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>alongside of the hostess. We had pie at every meal—a
fresh pie at lunch and supper, and pieces of left-over
pie for breakfast. Of course we need not eat pie, but
so much pie was disconcerting. That coffee pot on the
floor was disconcerting also. One of the boarders disturbed
us, too. He was a minister and a very good young
man, but when he wanted a piece of pie he looked straight
at it, like a pointer dog, until <a id='tn154a'></a>some one asked him to
have a piece. I had boarded for two years and I was
growing tired of boarding. My position as a teacher in
Rochambeau College was pleasant but I was growing
restless.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next Saturday I started to drive my car to
Trenton. I was fond of reading, and it was my custom
to visit Traver’s <a id='tn154b'></a>bookstore in Trenton or Leary’s in
Philadelphia and purchase several books at a time.
These second hand books answered my purpose perfectly
and were much cheaper than new books. Sometimes
I also attended vendues in the country and bought
books, but this was not usually very satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c015'>I had driven about a mile down the river when I overtook
two girls traveling afoot in the same direction. One
of them was very pretty. I asked them to get in. They
looked doubtfully at each other but finally accepted my
invitation. The oldest one told me her name was Fanny
Hilltop and the pretty girl was her younger sister, Mary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Mary was rather quiet but seemed very pleasant. She
smiled very often and when she smiled she showed a very
pretty set of very white teeth. I had always admired
white teeth and pretty girls and Mary seemed very nice.
We came to a cross road very soon and the girls said they
must get down there, they lived about a mile up the side
road. I told them I was out for a ride, which was true
enough, and that I might as well take them home, but
they warned me the road was rough and hilly.</p>

<p class='c015'>I turned into the by-road and though it was rough
and rocky got along very well for over half a mile; then
we came to a short, very steep hill. The car snorted
and puffed and finally stopped. I let it back down, put
on full speed and went at it again. It stuck fast again.
By this time the girls had grown nervous backing down
the hill, so I pulled the car to one side of the road and we
walked to their house up several hills and directly on top
of a mountain overlooking two beautiful valleys, one on
either side. Their house was a very pretty one painted
white. I told Mary that they had a right to the name of
Hilltop but she said I had misunderstood, it was Hillpot.
“Oh,” said I, “that must be a mistake. I believe
one of your ancestors was a poor speller and twisted
the spelling.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The girls invited me to come in and rest or at least to
sit down on the porch awhile. I chose the latter. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>mother came out after awhile and I was introduced. She
was a pleasant-looking, motherly soul, quick-motioned
and rather thin. Her face was seamed with fine wrinkles
and her hands showed signs of hard usage. I liked her
looks and I liked Mary, too. They invited me to stay
to dinner and I accepted. Fanny went to help her
mother with the dinner while Mary entertained me. The
father and a half grown boy came in after awhile.</p>

<p class='c015'>Old man Hillpot looked me over pretty sharply, and
I thought I knew just what he was thinking, but I
wasn’t thinking that at all. The boy looked at Mary and
then at me and then he grinned and Mary’s eyes snapped.
I knew what he thought and what she thought. The old
lady had a pleasant smile on her face as if she never
thought at all, but I knew that she was doing a heap more
thinking than all the others put together; for she was
figuring out what each one thought and then what she
should do herself so that everything should come out all
right. I was getting to like the old lady.</p>

<p class='c015'>After dinner Mary and I went out on the porch. The
old lady and Fanny washed the dishes. The old man
and the boy went off to milk the cows but the boy winked
at Mary before he started and her eyes snapped again.
After we had talked awhile I excused myself to get a
drink in the kitchen. The old lady was washing the
dishes. She had a dish pan full of soapy water and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>dish cloth. First she scraped all the dishes as clean as
possible; then she put them in the soapy water and
rubbed them with the cloth; then she put them into
another pan full of very hot water, took them out and
laid them on the table. I got a towel and wiped them for
her. She said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“This isn’t the first time you wiped dishes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How do you know?” I replied.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Because you washed your hands first, and you don’t
touch the dishes with your hands.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,<a id='tn157'></a>” I said, “I used to help my mother.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is your mother living?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” I answered, “she died two years ago.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, you poor boy,” she said; and she looked at me
very sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary had come into the kitchen by this time but I
thought she seemed somewhat bored. Pretty soon the
old man and the boy came back and we all went out on
the porch and had a real folksy talk. The boy was very
much interested in the college and asked me a great
many questions about it. He said he thought of going
to college if it didn’t cost too much. I told him it would
be all right to go to college but I hoped after he got out
he would come back and help his father farm. He said
he didn’t know about that and grinned at the old man;
but the old man seemed very quiet; he just sat and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>listened; sometimes I thought he seemed a little sad. He
appeared to be very fond of Fanny; he often looked at
her, and when he did a pleasant look came over his face.</p>

<p class='c015'>The old lady asked me to come again, real cordially,
and then we all shook hands and I started off.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was beginning to get dark when I reached the car.
I was just ready to turn the crank when I heard some
one say: “Get up Billy.” I looked up and found a pretty
girl in a falling top was trying to make her horse pass
the machine. He was frightened and wouldn’t go and
the girl seemed to be frightened too.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was the law in those days that when a person
driving a horse met an auto and held up a hand, the auto
driver must drive to the side of the road, stop his car
and lead the horse past the machine. So I went to the
horse’s head and led him past the machine. When we
had gone a short distance up the road I asked the girl
whether she could drive him now? She said she was
afraid of him, he might run away. She didn’t like to
drive anyhow but there was no one to drive her that
afternoon so she had hitched up the horse herself. I
told her I would drive her home if it was not too far.
She said her house was only half a mile up the road, so
I got in and took the reins. The horse was old and stiff,
but as his nose was pointed toward home and oats he
made steady progress and we soon arrived. I had introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>myself to the lady who informed me that her
name was Horner, that she taught school in the neighborhood
and boarded at the farm house to which we were
going. I remarked that Horner was a rural name and
smelled of the dairy at which she managed to crack a
smile. We had come by a side road at the last, down into
a valley, over a bridge and up the other side to the farm
house.</p>

<p class='c015'>The farmer came out and held the horse while I
helped the lady out. By this time the mother and her
two daughters, Sarah and Jane Oldit, had come out and
been introduced. We sat on the porch for awhile and
then I started for home once more murmuring: Hilltop,
Hillpot, Horner, Oldit!</p>

<h3 class='c017'>II</h3>

<p class='c018'>Rochambeau College was denominational and of the
blue Presbyterian order, under the care of the Synod.
This connection was, however, almost purely theoretical
and we were very much left alone to our own devices
so long as no attempt was made by the President or members
of the Faculty to blow loud heretical trumpets.
Most of the members of the Board of Trustees were
good fellows, mildly interested in the church and very
much interested in educating young men. This real interest
was manifested in an unmistakeable manner by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>their steady contributions to the College finances which
at this time were not in too flourishing a condition. Not
a few of the Trustees were depriving themselves of
luxuries and even necessities in order that the Faculty
might have decent living conditions. Not all the members
of the Faculty appreciated this, but I did. Most of
the members of our Board were earnest men worthy of
respect and I, for one, did thoroughly respect them. The
President, Dr. Camden, was a genial old chap, prone to
discover all sorts of excellencies in the members of his
Faculty and active in proclaiming them to the Board and
to the world. He used the same methods with the students
and was able to rule without despotism.</p>

<p class='c015'>Some of his methods were, however quite near the
border line which divides the good from the bad, and
aroused the condemnation of some more rigid members
of the Faculty who were rich enough to be independent.
In most cases his makeshift measures were made necessary
by lack of funds, and were, therefore, forgivable.</p>

<p class='c015'>On my return home I found a letter awaiting me, and
next morning, after my first class had recited I went to
see the President. He came peering into the room with
a frown on his face. On recognizing me his face lighted
up and he advanced with both hands open and a beaming
face.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear Brown! I am so glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“I came over, Doctor,” said I, “to see whether you
would be so good as to advise me? I have just had an
offer from Ashton University, and am undecided what I
had better do. I like my work very much here but they
have offered me more money.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is very good of you, Brown, to come to me at once
and I appreciate it. I should be very sorry to have you
leave, and if you will tell me whether a small addition to
your salary will induce you to stay I will ask the Trustees
to add, let us say, $200.00 to your allowance. But
now, my dear fellow I must ask you to do me a favor.
You know that Professor Last is to leave us at the end
of the year and I want you to teach Metallurgy.
Only two lectures a week for one term, you know?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Doctor, I am not posted on Metallurgy.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, but I feel sure you can do excellently well. It
is very simple. You put the ore and fuel into a furnace,
light the fire and there you are. And Brown! now we
have settled that, I want you to take tea with me to-morrow
evening. I must try to see more of you. I
must see that you are taken care of.”</p>

<p class='c015'><a id='tn161'></a>I laughed, thanked the Doctor, said I would come,
and took my leave.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next evening six people sat down at the President’s
table: the Doctor and his wife, his niece, Kitty
Camden and her brother Searles, Miss Hetty Poiret and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>myself. Kitty Camden was tall and stately while Hetty
Poiret was quite small, with a rather shy manner and a
sweet smile. Searles was younger than his sister, rather
boyish in manner but a nice ingenuous lad. He was tall
like his sister and nervous; his hands twitched, and he
threw out his head from time to time as if his collar
hurt him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There are several ages represented here,” said the
Doctor, “I think I must tell my frog story.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no, Henry!” said his wife.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do, Doctor!” I broke in, “I have never heard it, and
I like your stories.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There, Helen,” said the Doctor, “you see one person
likes my stories.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We all like them, Doctor,” said Hetty Poiret<a id='tn162'></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” he began, “there is a place down below Philadelphia
where the Schuylkill empties into the Delaware.
The shores are low, flat and marshy. Tall grass grows
down to the river’s edge; and here the tiny little frogs
gather in the shallows as evening falls and peep shrilly:
Schuyl—kill! Schuyl—kill! Schuyl—kill!</p>

<p class='c015'>“Further up the river a creek flows in. There are
trees along the bank. There is a very narrow beach with
the banks rising abruptly and prevented from falling in
by the tree roots. Here the middle-sized frogs gather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>in the evenings and call in middle-sized voices: Wis—sa—he—con!
Wis—sa—he—con! Wis—sa—he—con!</p>

<p class='c015'>“Further up, the stream is deeper. There are high
banks which shelve off rapidly into deeper water. Along
the edges solemn shadows form as the sun sets, and here
the big bullies gather and croak in solemn tones: Man—yunk!
Man—yunk! Man—yunk!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I like that story<a id='tn163'></a>,” said Helen, “it is cute.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I like it, Doctor, that’s a good one,” I said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You never told me that one before,” said Kitty Camden, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Doctor laughed. Then he began telling us about
his travels. His wife had accompanied him, and occasionally
she broke into the narrative to remind him of
something he had forgotten. I have forgotten most of
what he told us but I remember one part clearly. He
said they had traveled over the Splugen on the Via Mala
in a one-horse victoria driven by a black-browed, surly
Italian. Coming down the southern slopes they passed
through great groves of giant chestnuts. Nothing else
would grow there, for immense rocks covered the surface
and made cultivation impossible. These trees bore crops
of the large Italian chestnuts with which we are familiar
from seeing them on our fruit stands. These are
gathered by the peasants and stored in bags in the lofts
overhead until they are well dried. They are then taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>down and beaten with sticks. This breaks the hulls
which are winnowed out. The meat is then beaten to
flour in mortars and <i>polenta</i> or mush made of it which
forms almost the only food of the peasants.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>III</h3>

<p class='c018'>As Trenton had not been reached the preceding Saturday,
I determined to try again and to take Sally with
me. Sally said she would be delighted to go. Next
morning at about eight we were ready for the trip. It
was a beautiful morning and Sally was as sparklingly
pretty as a morning daisy. It was a pleasure to look at
her. She had a parcel done up in paper which I stored
in the tonneau. When I turned the crank nothing happened.
I turned the crank again—still nothing happened.
At the third turn there were two explosions and then
silence. Fourth turn, ditto. Fifth turn, the engine ran
for some time and just as we were ready to move stopped
again. By this time my patience had a very thin edge,
but, fortunately, the next turn gave the desired result and
we were off.</p>

<p class='c015'>My car had a serious defect: the radiator was too small
and the water grew hot and boiled about every three
miles. If there was much climbing the distance traveled
before this happened was less. In consequence it was
necessary to let the boiling water escape and provide a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>fresh charge, which required frequent running to the
pump with a collapsible bucket.</p>

<p class='c015'>About three miles from our starting place we reached
a roadside spring and I replaced the water and plied the
oil can. Not many yards below the spring we overtook
a young lady walking in the direction we were going.
It was Miss Horner on her way to the village just below.
We stopped and asked her to ride with us. She was on
her way to her school for some books which had been
forgotten. On reaching the school we were invited to
inspect it. It was an old-fashioned place, painted yellow
outside, with a large coal stove at one side and blackboards
surrounding the room on all the available wall
space. There was a bench before the teacher’s desk on
which the lazy or naughty pupils stood during the noon
or recess periods.</p>

<p class='c015'>After we left her Sally was very inquisitive. She
wanted to know who she was, where she came from, how
and where I had met her. Satisfied on these points we
proceeded happily on our way. Presently the car began
to steam and I to look for a watering place. The canal
was close to the road, and after considerable searching
I found a place where it was possible to reach the water
with my bucket. I succeeded in doing so after some
stretching but in lifting the bucket the weight of the
water overbalanced me and down into the water I slid.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Sally cried out in alarm but wasted no time in thrusting
a stick from the roadside into my hands. Then I was
slowly and carefully pulled in and helped up the bank.
I was in a pretty pickle. Wet from head to foot; my
collar and shirt in collapse; my shoes filled with water,
and my hat gone. I told Sally it did not matter. It was
warm and I would soon dry off. As for my hat and collar
I could replace them at the next country store. She
said I was very brave and she was proud of me; and
as she said this her eyes sparkled and her cheeks were
full of rosy color. I had been very much surprised at
her prompt, vigorous action in helping me and also at
the strength she displayed. With her permission I removed
my coat and shoes and laid them to dry in the
tonneau. Then with a considerable increase in cordiality
we once more took the road. At frequent intervals we
were obliged to water the car and might fairly be said
to have worked our passage. At Lehnenburg or Monroe
we entered the red shale country which extends to Trenton
and below. In many places this shale is covered
with river sand or is replaced by sandstone rock belonging
to the same formation but less strongly colored with
iron oxide. Over roads varying in character but mostly
bad we proceeded. From Erwinna to Point Pleasant the
road was especially bad, being both rocky and muddy.
By careful driving I managed to avoid splashing the car
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>very badly. At New Hope we crossed the river and proceeded
toward Trenton. It was now time for lunch and
we drew up by the roadside under a maple and Sally produced
her package which contained a lunch fit for kings.
This we discussed amid a cheerful rain of jokes and
chaff.</p>

<p class='c015'>After lunch we proceeded and soon entered State
Street and turned down South Broad. There were few
cars in those days and no traffic policemen so that we
could turn the car on South Broad and draw up before
the bookstore.</p>

<p class='c015'>I was a great admirer of Stockton and Stevenson and
so I found was Sally. In the stock of second hand books
by these authors we found copies of “The Lady and the
Tiger,” “The Casting Away of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs.
Aleshine,” “The Christmas Wreck” and “Amos Kilbright”
by Stockton and “The Black Arrow,” “Kidnapped”
and “The Strange Case of Mr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde” by Stephenson. These we considered a great find
and the price was very reasonable. They were stowed
in the tonneau and Sally took her seat while I turned the
crank. This time we started off without trouble.</p>

<p class='c015'>We had got as far as Lambertville on the return when
trouble with the car began to develop. The engine would
run properly for awhile and then it would slow down and
almost stop, then it would start running properly again.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>This continued until we were several miles above New
Hope. Here the engine gave out completely. After trying
in vain to start it again I abandoned hope and Sally
and I pushed the car to the roadside and started off for
help. We walked nearly a mile before we came to a
house. I knocked at the door which was opened by a
nice-looking boy of about ten years. In answer to my
enquiry he said his Pop was at the barn and if we would
sit down he would go after him. Presently the boy’s
mother came in and we told her the car had broken down.
She thought we had better spend the night there and go
on in the morning. She had a spare room which we
might use. I thought further explanations were in order
and the old lady said if I would be content with a cot the
young lady might have the spare room and I could sleep
in the attic. I thanked her and, after consulting Sally,
accepted. When the farmer came in we found nothing
else could be done. He promised to drive me to New
Hope in the morning and get a mechanic. I lay awake
for a long time wondering what could be the matter.
Finally it occurred to me that the gasoline might have
given out. The next morning we had an early breakfast
and the farmer and I drove to the car. Sure enough
we found the tank as dry as a bone. Then we went on
to New Hope and after some searching found gasoline
and partly filled the tank. After turning the engine over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>several times it caught and we drove up to the house.
Sally seemed to be worried but she said very little. On
the way home she said she was afraid her mother might
worry and wished there were some way to get word to
her. I suggested that we telegraph but we found all the
offices closed.</p>

<p class='c015'>About 11 o’clock we reached home. I went in with
Sally. Her mother seemed worried. She said she had
been very much distressed by our non-arrival the night
before and looked at me searchingly. I told her I had
been very stupid but she must remember I had run a car
only a short time and was not very experienced. Sally
said she was sure I was not to blame.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next day I needed some money and went to the
bank. Jim Barkley waited on me and after he had
cashed the check said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hear you were stalled the other day because you had
no gasoline? Pretty slick excuse.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” I said, “do you think so?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ho, ho,” he said, “ho, ho!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He, he,” I said, “he, he!”</p>

<p class='c015'>He looked pretty black at this but said nothing more.</p>

<p class='c015'>I went to call on Sally that evening and she greeted me
with smiles. She wanted to know whether I had caught
cold? I said no, I had not. She told me she thought
Jim Barkley was very disagreeable. He had been making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>nasty remarks about me. He had told Hetty Poiret that
I was a prig. She thought he was very ugly-tempered
and very stupid. Before I left she asked me whether I
often took cold. I said I did. She advised me if I felt
I was taking cold to soak my feet in hot water in a
wooden bucket, the water should be very hot and contain
a teaspoonful of soda. Then I must wipe my feet with a
dry, hot towel and get into bed. She did not say retire,
she said get into bed. I had not had such advice since
my mother died two years before. She looked very
earnest and very much concerned as she said it. It was
not a romantic speech but somehow I liked to have her
say it.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>IV</h3>

<p class='c018'>The following Saturday I planned to take a trip to
Doylestown. I had some relatives there whom I had not
seen for some time and Fanny and Mary Hillpot had
agreed to go with me. Their cousin lived there. I was
doubtful about my ability to drive my car to the Hillpot
house and experiment proved my doubt to be well
founded. By making a strong spurt I succeeded in getting
up the first hill but stuck fast on the second. I
climbed the rest of the hill afoot. Mary was as pretty
as a picture and I admired her very much. She certainly
had beautiful teeth and was all smiles when I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>arrived. The girls were soon ready and we walked to
the car and started. Mary was beside me and Fanny in
the tonneau with some wraps, two umbrellas and some
lunch. We were nearing Kintnersville when dark clouds
began to pile up on the horizon and presently it began
to rain. The girls were in the tonneau each with an
umbrella and I was on the front seat with a rubber coat
and hat. The rain came down in bucketfuls and then
began to blow. The water collected in a pool on the front
seat and ran down my leg into my shoe. The girls’ feet
and skirts got wet and Mary began to cry. Fanny was
just as wet but she laughed and seemed to be enjoying
herself. I drove as rapidly as possible and got under a
shed at Ferndale. Mary was as cross as a wet hen. Her
hair had lost its curl, her hat was awry and she showed
neither smile nor white teeth. The girls went into the
hotel and after quite a long stay came out somewhat drier
and ready to proceed. But Mary was sulky and disagreeable.
After the shower passed over we started
again, but now there was mud everywhere—thin splashy
red mud that flew over everything. At Pipersville Hill it
was necessary for the girls to walk up the hill and their
feet were very muddy and wet. Between Pipersville and
Plumstedville there was a swampy spot where the car
stuck fast. Fanny helped me get stones to put under the
wheels while Mary sat on the fence and glowered at us.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Finally we got started again and reached Doylestown.
Here we separated. While I was visiting my cousins a
hostler washed the car and after it was ready I drove
around, took the girls in and started for home. We got
back without accident and then I visited the Oldit place.
Sarah and Jane were at home but Miss Horner had not
arrived. We sat on the front porch and the girls raked
over the characters of all the neighbors. I found they
had had a disagreement also with Miss Horner. There
were several vicious digs given after she arrived and I
departed somewhat depressed.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next evening I took Sally to Dr. Camden’s to
call on the young visitors. We found Jim Barkley there.
He paid marked attention to Hetty Poiret all the evening.
Occasionally he glanced at Sally or me but we avoided
him as much as possible. We did not have a very pleasant
evening. Searles and Kitty had been quarreling and
were still skirmishing. We left early and walked home
in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next morning people who met me looked unusually
pleasant and seemed amused. I could not understand it
until I reached Sally’s house again. She met me at the
door and called to her mother as I came in:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here he is mother! Now we shall see!”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Did you know,” she said turning to me, “that Jim
Barkley says that you were in Doylestown yesterday
driving two girls in a red devil as drunk as a lord?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” I replied, “I did not. I was in Doylestown
driving my red car and Fanny and Mary Hillpot were
with me but I was not drunk. I had had nothing at all
to drink.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There, Mother,” said Sally, “I told you he did not
drink.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And did you know,” she continued<a id='tn173a'></a>, “that he says we
stayed at a farm house together on Saturday night, and
then he winks.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The dirty dog,” I said, “I think I can stop his mouth.”</p>

<p class='c015'><a id='tn173b'></a>Sally and her mother were both in tears but I comforted
them by telling them that I would bring the
farmer and his wife up next day. I did so and drove
around to Dr. Camden’s house. I told the Doctor my
story and asked him to question the farmer and his wife.
He agreed to this and did so. Then I drove them to the
bank and asked Mr. Davis, the President of the bank
to listen to them in Jim Barkley’s presence. Jim declared
that he had been misquoted but I brought Hetty
Poiret to the bank to contradict him. Then I took the
farmer and his wife back home after warmly thanking
them.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>That evening I went again to see Sally. She blushed
beautifully as she opened the door. “Sally!” I said, “I
came here to tell you that you are the dearest, sweetest,
prettiest, smartest, nicest girl in the world, and that I
love you, love you, love you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, do you?” said Sally, “I am so glad.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Did you ever hear of the young man whose ecstasy
was so great under similar conditions that he broke the
poor girl’s ribs?<a id='tn174'></a>” I did not break Sally’s ribs but I held
her tight and she laughed and her eyes sparkled and
then she cried a little. Presently she said she must tell
her father and mother. They all came in presently and
shook hands with me and her mother kissed me. “If
Sally loves you I must too,” she said, and then she
wiped her eyes. They both looked sad. “You know,
she is our baby,” her father said, “and it is pretty hard to
lose her. Please be good to her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>I said: “I don’t think I am much account, but Sally
says she loves me and I’m sure I love her, and I will
promise you to be good to her and try to be a better man
every day.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Well, we had a fashionable wedding in a month from
that time. Jim Barkley was not present because he was
looking for another job in New York. Sally and I have
been married now for twenty years and have two fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>boys in college. Sally is getting as round as a dumpling,
but I like her so much I never notice what she looks like.
Neither do the boys. So much kindness shines from her
eyes when she looks at us that we see nothing else.</p>
